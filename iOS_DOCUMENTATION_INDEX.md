## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Tab-Based Navigation
4 main tabs never change. Content accessed via sheets (popups).

### 2. SwiftData + CloudKit
All data persisted locally (SwiftData), synced to cloud (CloudKit).

### 3. Service Singletons
Background services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) are singletons configured at app launch.

### 4. Voice-First Design
SmartVoiceButton always accessible (persistent floating button).

### 5. Environment-Based DI
Swift's Environment pattern for dependency injection (localization, offline mode, voice commands).

### 6. Canvas Rendering
Mind maps use Canvas (not UIView) for performance.

### 7. Offline Support
Materials cached locally, sync deferred until online.
