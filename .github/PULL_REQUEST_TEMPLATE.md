## ✨ Features

### Liquid Glass Design System (macOS 26)
- 🪟 **Translucent sidebar** - Blurs background, reduces visual clutter
- 🎨 **Tinted glass cards** - Subject colors shine through glass materials
- ✨ **Floating toolbar** - Glass surface that adapts to content beneath
- ♿️ **Accessibility-first** - Respects "Reduce Transparency" setting

### Apple Intelligence Integration
- ✍️ **Writing Tools** (Cmd+Shift+W) - Helps Mario with dysgraphia
  - Rewrite, Proofread, Summarize, Key Points
  - Works in all text fields throughout the app
- 🗣️ **Siri 2.0** - Natural language app control
  - "Hey Siri, add this PDF to math materials"
  - "Hey Siri, explain fractions like Fortnite"
- 🔍 **AI-Powered Spotlight** - Search materials by concept
  - "materials about fractions with visual examples"
  - Quick actions: "Summarize physics chapter 2"

### Keyboard Shortcuts (One-Handed Optimized)
All shortcuts designed for **right-hand only** operation (critical for Mario's left hemiplegia):

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Cmd+1** | Materials |
| **Cmd+2** | Study |
| **Cmd+3** | Tasks |
| **Cmd+4** | Voice |
| **Cmd+Shift+V** | Voice Conversation (PRIMARY) |
| **Cmd+Shift+W** | Writing Tools (AI) |
| **Cmd+Shift+T** | Always on Top |
| **Cmd+Shift+L** | Toggle Sidebar |
| **Cmd+/** | Show All Shortcuts |

### Window Management
- 📐 **Default size**: 1200×800 (optimized for 13" MacBook split screen)
- 💾 **Position persistence** - Restores window size/position on launch
- 📌 **Always on Top** (Cmd+Shift+T) - Great for study sessions
- 🎯 **Auto-centering** - Centers on first launch

### Accessibility (Mario-Focused)
- 📖 **OpenDyslexic everywhere** - Dyslexia-friendly typography
- 🖱️ **44px+ click targets** - Easy to hit with mouse/trackpad
- ⌨️ **100% keyboard accessible** - No mouse required
- 🔊 **VoiceOver support** - Full screen reader compatibility
- 🎨 **WCAG AAA compliance** - 7:1 contrast minimum
- 🌓 **Dark mode optimized** - Comfortable for extended study sessions

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Code Sharing Strategy
- **95% shared** - Core/, Services/, Features/ work on both platforms
- **5% platform-specific** - Window management, menu bar, glass effects
- **Clean separation** - `#if os(macOS)` guards where needed

### Shared Components
- ✅ All SwiftData models (Material, Subject, Task, etc.)
- ✅ All business logic services (sync, processing, API clients)
- ✅ All SwiftUI views (Dashboard, Study, Tasks, Voice)
- ✅ OpenDyslexic font extensions
- ✅ CloudKit sync (identical on macOS)

### Platform-Specific
- ❌ Camera/Scanner (iOS VisionKit) - Disabled on macOS
- ❌ Haptic feedback (iOS UIKit) - Replaced with NSSound on macOS
- ✅ Window management (macOS AppKit)
- ✅ Menu bar commands (macOS-only)

---

## 🎯 Target Platform

- **macOS 26.0+ "Tahoe"** (October 2025)
- **Apple Silicon only** (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- **Xcode 16.0+** required for Liquid Glass APIs
- **Swift 6** with strict concurrency

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions
