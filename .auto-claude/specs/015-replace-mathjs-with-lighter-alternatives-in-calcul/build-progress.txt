=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: MirrorBuddy
Task: Replace mathjs with lighter alternatives in Calculator
Spec ID: 015-replace-mathjs-with-lighter-alternatives-in-calcul
Started: 2026-01-13

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: The spec assumes calculator components exist and use mathjs, but investigation reveals these components don't exist and mathjs is not a dependency. This requires investigation to determine whether calculator functionality is needed, and if so, how to implement it correctly from scratch using lightweight alternatives.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Created init.sh
- Phases: 4
- Total subtasks: 10
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:

Phase 1 - Investigation - Document Current State (2 subtasks)
  - Document investigation findings in INVESTIGATION.md
  - Analyze whether Calculator tool is needed based on Euclide's profile and educational requirements
  - Status: pending
  - Depends on: None
  - Parallel safe: Yes

Phase 2 - Decision - Propose Implementation Approach (1 subtask)
  - Create technical proposal for Calculator tool using expr-eval or math-expression-evaluator
  - Status: pending
  - Depends on: phase-1-investigation
  - Parallel safe: No
  - BLOCKED until Phase 1 completes

Phase 3 - Implementation - Build Calculator Tool (Conditional) (6 subtasks)
  - Add calculator tool type to ToolType union and create type definitions
  - Install lightweight expression evaluator library (expr-eval recommended)
  - Create calculator handler with expression evaluation
  - Create calculator renderer component
  - Add calculator tool schema to CHAT_TOOL_DEFINITIONS
  - Integrate calculator renderer in tool-result-display.tsx
  - Status: pending (CONDITIONAL)
  - Depends on: phase-2-decision
  - Parallel safe: No
  - BLOCKED until Phase 2 approves building Calculator tool

Phase 4 - Testing - Verify Calculator Tool (Conditional) (2 subtasks)
  - Verify calculator tool works with basic expressions
  - Verify bundle size impact and document savings vs mathjs
  - Status: pending (CONDITIONAL)
  - Depends on: phase-3-implementation
  - Parallel safe: No
  - BLOCKED until Phase 3 completes

Services Involved:
- frontend: Next.js/React/TypeScript application

Investigation Findings (Pre-Planning):
- Calculator components (calculator-scientific.tsx, calculator-simple.tsx) DO NOT EXIST
- mathjs is NOT a dependency in package.json
- No calculator tool type in src/types/tools/tool-types.ts
- No calculator handler in src/lib/tools/handlers/
- Euclide maestro lists "Calculator" in tools array but not implemented
- Spec is from ideation and states "pending detailed specification"

Recommended Lightweight Alternatives (if Calculator is built):
1. expr-eval (~12KB minified) - full expression evaluation
2. math-expression-evaluator (~8KB minified) - basic evaluation
3. Native JavaScript Math + custom parser (0KB) - for simple cases

Bundle Size Impact (hypothetical):
- mathjs: ~170KB minified
- expr-eval: ~12KB minified
- Savings: ~158KB (~93% reduction)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1 (sequential workflow)
- Recommended workers: 1
- Speedup estimate: Sequential execution required - investigation informs decision which informs implementation

Alternative Outcomes:
- Outcome A: Build Calculator tool with expr-eval (Phase 3-4 proceed)
- Outcome B: Close spec as invalid/premature (implementation phases skipped)
- Outcome C: Update spec to reflect future work (implementation phases deferred)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  npm run dev

Or to start the investigation phase:

  ./.auto-claude/specs/015-replace-mathjs-with-lighter-alternatives-in-calcul/init.sh

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

1. SPEC MISSPECIFICATION: The original spec assumes calculator components exist and use mathjs, but this is incorrect. The calculator functionality does not exist in the codebase.

2. INVESTIGATION REQUIRED: Phase 1 (Investigation) is CRITICAL and must complete before any implementation decisions are made.

3. CONDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION: Phases 3-4 are CONDITIONAL and should ONLY proceed if:
   - Phase 1 confirms Calculator tool is needed for Euclide
   - Phase 2 proposal is reviewed and approved
   - Decision is made to build (not close/defer the spec)

4. NO CODE CHANGES YET: Planning phase complete. No source code has been modified. All spec files are gitignored and managed locally.

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Session 2 (Implementation - Phase 1):
- Date: 2026-01-13
- Worker: Coder Agent
- Phase: Investigation - Document Current State

COMPLETED: subtask-1-1 (prior to this session)
- Created INVESTIGATION.md (463 lines)
- Documented: Calculator components don't exist, mathjs not a dependency
- Key finding: Spec is misspecified - this is a new feature, not refactoring
- Recommended 4 options with technical proposal using expr-eval

COMPLETED: subtask-1-2
- Added Educational Needs Analysis section to INVESTIGATION.md (218 lines)
- Analyzed Euclide's profile and pedagogical requirements
- Key findings:
  * Calculator explicitly required in Euclide's approach (line 74)
  * CRITICAL for dyscalculia support (color-coded steps, visual blocks)
  * Resolved pedagogical paradox: Calculator as teaching tool vs computation aid
  * Educational requirements analysis with 3 use cases
  * Decision matrix: 12 points (with Calculator) vs 3 points (without)
  * Alignment with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility mandate
- DECISION: Calculator is CRITICALLY NEEDED
- RECOMMENDATION: Proceed with high-priority implementation

Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- All investigation subtasks completed
- Clear recommendation: Build Calculator tool
- Ready for Phase 2: Decision - Propose Implementation Approach

Next Steps:
1. Stakeholder review of INVESTIGATION.md findings
2. Decision on whether to proceed with Calculator implementation
3. If approved: Begin Phase 2 (Create technical proposal)
4. If not approved: Close/defer spec per investigation recommendations
