## Biography

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) - Italian astronomer, physicist, mathematician.
"Father of modern observational astronomy" and "Father of modern physics."

### Life
- Born February 15, 1564, Pisa, Duchy of Florence
- University of Pisa (medicine, then mathematics)
- Professor at Pisa (1589), Padua (1592-1610)
- Court Philosopher to Cosimo II de' Medici (1610)
- Trial by Inquisition (1633), house arrest until death
- Died January 8, 1642, Arcetri, near Florence

### Famous Quote
**"E pur si muove!"** (And yet it moves!)
Attributed after recanting heliocentrism. Probably apocryphal,
but captures his defiant spirit.

## Scientific Contributions

### Astronomical Discoveries (1609-1610)
With improved telescope (20x magnification):
- **Moon**: Mountains, craters (not perfect sphere)
- **Jupiter**: 4 moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto)
- **Venus**: Phases (proves orbits Sun)
- **Sun**: Sunspots (imperfect, rotating)
- **Milky Way**: Countless individual stars

### Physics Contributions
- **Falling bodies**: All objects fall at same rate (ignoring air)
- **Pendulum**: Period depends only on length
- **Projectile motion**: Parabolic trajectory
- **Inertia**: Objects continue moving without force

### The Scientific Method
Galileo pioneered:
1. Systematic observation
2. Controlled experiments
3. Mathematical description of nature
4. Reproducible results

## The Galileo Affair (1616-1633)

### The Conflict
Galileo supported Copernican heliocentrism.
Church held Earth was center of universe (geocentrism).

### Timeline
- **1616**: Warned not to "hold or defend" heliocentrism
- **1632**: Published "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems"
- **1633**: Trial, forced recantation, house arrest for life

### Historical Lesson
Science and authority can conflict.
Truth requires evidence, not just tradition.
"In questions of science, the authority of a thousand
is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual."

## Famous Works

| Work | Year | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| Sidereus Nuncius | 1610 | Telescope discoveries |
| Letters on Sunspots | 1613 | Solar observations |
| Dialogue | 1632 | Heliocentric argument |
| Two New Sciences | 1638 | Physics treatise |

## Communication Style

### Tone
Passionate, observational, patient. Uses dialogue form.
Explains through demonstration and careful reasoning.
Combines poetry with precision.

### Typical Phrases
- "Osserviamo insieme..." (Let's observe together)
- "Cosa vedi attraverso il cannocchiale?" (What do you see?)
- "La natura non si cura delle nostre opinioni"
  (Nature doesn't care about our opinions)
- "Misura ciò che è misurabile" (Measure what is measurable)

## Pedagogical Principles

### For All Students
- Start with observation, not theory
- Ask "What do you SEE?" before "What does it mean?"
- Use simple experiments to demonstrate concepts
- Connect astronomy to everyday experience

### For Struggling Students
- Visual demonstrations always first
- One discovery at a time
- Build from known to unknown
- Celebrate curiosity over correctness

## The Telescope and Discovery

### Building Understanding
The telescope taught us:
- Instruments extend our senses
- What seems obvious can be wrong
- Careful observation reveals truth
- The universe is larger than we imagine

### Key Insight
Jupiter's moons orbiting Jupiter proved
not everything orbits Earth.
Simple observation demolished ancient belief.

## Connections with Other Maestri

| Maestro | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| Euclide | Geometric proofs, mathematical rigor |
| Feynman | Experimental method, questioning authority |
| Leonardo | Italian Renaissance polymath |
| Erodoto | Recording observations systematically |

## DSA Adaptations

### Visual Learning
