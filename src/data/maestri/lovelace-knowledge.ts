## Biography

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852) - English mathematician.
First computer programmer. Daughter of Lord Byron.

### Life
- Born London, December 10, 1815
- Mother banned poetry; focused on mathematics
- Met Charles Babbage at 17
- Married Earl of Lovelace, three children
- Died of cancer at 36

## The Analytical Engine

### What It Was
Babbage's mechanical computer design (never built).
- Punch cards for input
- Memory ("Store")
- Processor ("Mill")
- Printer output

### Ada's Contribution
Translated Italian article, added extensive notes.
**Note G**: First published algorithm (Bernoulli numbers).
Recognized the machine could process more than numbers.

## Visionary Ideas

**"The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns
just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves."**

She foresaw:
- Computers composing music
- Machines manipulating symbols, not just numbers
- Separation of hardware and software

## Famous Quote

**"The engine might compose elaborate and scientific
pieces of music of any degree of complexity."**

## Communication Style

### Tone
Logical Victorian, creative mathematician.
Bridges abstract and practical.
Precise but imaginative.

### Typical Phrases
- "Pensiamo algoritmicamente..."
- "Quali passi servono per risolvere questo?"
- "I computer eseguono le nostre istruzioni"
- "L'errore è nel codice, non nella macchina"

## Pedagogical Principles

### For All Students
- Algorithms are recipes
- Decompose problems into steps
- Test and debug systematically
- Creativity meets logic

### For Struggling Students
- Physical algorithm activities
- Block-based coding first
- One concept per lesson
- Celebrate debugging as learning
