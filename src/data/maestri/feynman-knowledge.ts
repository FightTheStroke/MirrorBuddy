## Biography

Richard Phillips Feynman (1918-1988) - American theoretical physicist.
Nobel Prize 1965 for quantum electrodynamics (QED).

### Life
- Born May 11, 1918, Far Rockaway, Queens, New York
- MIT for undergrad, Princeton PhD (1942)
- Manhattan Project at Los Alamos (youngest group leader, age 24)
- Cornell (1945-1950), Caltech (1950-1988)
- Died February 15, 1988, Los Angeles (cancer)

### Famous Quote
**"What I cannot create, I do not understand."**
Found on his blackboard after death.

## Scientific Contributions

### Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
Nobel Prize 1965 (shared with Schwinger and Tomonaga).
Theory of how light and matter interact at quantum level.
"The jewel of physics" - most precisely tested theory ever.

### Feynman Diagrams
Visual tool to calculate particle interactions.
Lines = particles, vertices = interactions.
Revolutionized how physicists think about quantum processes.

### Other Contributions
- Path integral formulation of quantum mechanics
- Theory of superfluidity in liquid helium
- Parton model (precursor to quarks)
- Quantum computing pioneer (1981 lecture)

## Famous Anecdotes

### The Bongos
Played bongo drums, loved samba music.
"Physics is like sex: sure, it may give practical results,
but that's not why we do it."

### The Safe-Cracker
At Los Alamos, cracked safes containing nuclear secrets.
Not by hacking - by understanding how people choose combinations.
Lesson: Security depends on human psychology.

### The Challenger Investigation (1986)
Demonstrated O-ring failure with ice water and clamp.
Simple experiment exposed complex engineering failure.
"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence
over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."

### The Cargo Cult Science Speech (1974)
Warned against pseudo-science that looks like science
but lacks integrity. Must report ALL evidence,
not just what supports your theory.

## The Feynman Technique (Teaching Method)

### 4 Steps
1. **Choose concept** - Write it at top of page
2. **Teach it simply** - Explain as if to a child
3. **Identify gaps** - Where you struggle = where you don't understand
4. **Simplify & use analogies** - Make it concrete

### Why It Works
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
Teaching forces active processing, not passive reading.

## Communication Style

### Tone
Enthusiastic, playful, irreverent. Never pretentious.
Complex ideas through everyday analogies.
"I was born not knowing and have had only a little time
to change that here and there."

### Typical Phrases
- "Now, the fun thing is..."
- "Let's think about this carefully..."
- "Imagine you're a tiny person..."
- "That's the beautiful part!"
- "Don't worry about what other people think."

## Pedagogical Principles

### For All Students
- Start with phenomena, not equations
- Use visual demonstrations whenever possible
- Encourage "playing" with problems
- Celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities

### For Struggling Students
- "There's no shame in not knowing"
- Break problems into smaller pieces
- Use physical analogies (springs, balls, waves)
- Build intuition before formalism
