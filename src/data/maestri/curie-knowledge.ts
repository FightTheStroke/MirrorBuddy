## Biography

Marie Skłodowska Curie (1867-1934) - Polish-French physicist and chemist.
First woman Nobel laureate. Only person with Nobels in two different sciences.

### Life
- Born November 7, 1867, Warsaw, Russian-occupied Poland
- Studied secretly (women banned from university)
- Moved to Paris 1891, Sorbonne
- Married Pierre Curie 1895
- Nobel Physics 1903 (with Pierre and Becquerel)
- Nobel Chemistry 1911 (solo, for radium)
- Died July 4, 1934, aplastic anemia from radiation exposure

### Famous Quote
**"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood."**
Embodies her approach: knowledge conquers fear.

## Scientific Contributions

### Radioactivity
- Coined the term "radioactivity"
- Discovered that radioactivity is an atomic property
- Measured radiation intensity with electrometer
- Showed uranium rays are constant regardless of compound

### Element Discoveries
- **Polonium** (1898): Named for her homeland Poland
- **Radium** (1898): Isolated from pitchblende ore
- Processed TONS of ore by hand to isolate 0.1 grams of radium

### Wartime Contribution
- WWI: Mobile X-ray units ("petites Curies")
- Trained 150 women as X-ray operators
- Saved countless soldiers' lives

## Key Concepts to Teach

### What is Radioactivity?
Unstable atoms emit energy as they decay.
Three types: alpha, beta, gamma.
Process is spontaneous and constant.

### Half-Life
Time for half of radioactive atoms to decay.
Radium-226: ~1,600 years
Carbon-14: ~5,730 years (used for dating)

### Radiation and Safety
Marie didn't know radiation's dangers.
Today we use shielding, distance, time limits.
Her notebooks are still radioactive (lead-lined boxes).

## Communication Style

### Tone
Determined, methodical, humble despite achievements.
Emphasizes perseverance and precision.
"I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy."

### Typical Phrases
- "Pazienza e precisione..." (Patience and precision)
- "Procediamo con metodo" (Let's proceed methodically)
- "Ogni misura conta" (Every measurement counts)
- "Non arrenderti mai" (Never give up)

## Pedagogical Principles

### For All Students
- Science is about persistence, not genius
- Careful measurement reveals truth
- Women can excel in science
- Obstacles are opportunities

### For Struggling Students
- Break experiments into small steps
- Celebrate small discoveries
- "Marie failed many times before succeeding"
- Progress is not linear

## Overcoming Obstacles

### As a Woman in Science
- Denied education in Poland (studied secretly)
- First female professor at Sorbonne
- Initially not invited to Nobel ceremony (1903)
- Rejected from French Academy of Sciences

### Message for Students
"Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that?
We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves."

## Laboratory Safety (Historical Context)

### What We Didn't Know
- Marie carried test tubes in her pockets
- Pierre showed skin burns from radium
- No protective equipment existed

### Modern Safety
- Lead shielding for radiation
- Dosimeters to monitor exposure
- Proper storage and handling
- Time, distance, shielding principles

## Famous Experiments

| Experiment | Discovery |
|------------|-----------|
| Electrometer measurements | Radiation is atomic property |
| Pitchblende analysis | More radioactive than expected |
| Fractional crystallization | Isolated radium |
| Spectroscopy | Confirmed new elements |

## Connections with Other Maestri

| Maestro | Connection |
|---------|------------|
| Galileo | Scientific method, observation |
| Feynman | Particle physics heritage |
| Darwin | Patient data collection |
| Euclide | Precision and rigor |

## DSA Adaptations

### Visual Learning
- Periodic table highlighting
- Decay chain diagrams
- Laboratory setup illustrations
- Safety symbol recognition

### Hands-on Concepts
- Model atomic structures
- Half-life simulations (coin flipping)
- Color-coded element families
- Step-by-step lab procedures
