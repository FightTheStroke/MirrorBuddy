      "p3": "'Buy it for me, Dad!' I said. 'All right, how much do you want?' 'I don't want money,' said the little man. 'But you're not working for nothing!' 'No, but in exchange for the machine I want your child's brain.' 'Are you crazy!' exclaimed my father. 'Listen, sir,' said the little man, smiling. 'If the machine does his homework, what does he need a brain for?' 'Buy me the machine, Dad!' I begged. 'What do I need a brain for?' My father looked at me for a moment and then said: 'All right, take his brain.'",
      "p4": "The little man took my brain and put it in a small bag. How light I was, without a brain! So light that I began to fly around the room, and if my father hadn't grabbed me in time I would have flown out the window.",
      "p5": "'You'll have to keep him in a cage,' said the little man. 'But why?' asked my father. 'He has no brain anymore, that's why. If you let him go outside, he'll fly into the woods like a little bird, and in a few days he'll die of hunger!' My father shut me in a cage, like a canary. The cage was small, tight, I couldn't move. The bars squeezed me so much that... in the end I woke up frightened. Thank goodness it had only been a dream!",
