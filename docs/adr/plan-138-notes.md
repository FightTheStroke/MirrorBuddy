# Plan 138 Running Notes

## W1: Critical Disclosure

- All i18n additions required manual completion for DE/ES locales (executor context limits)
- Audit trail service now 393 lines (was ~285), consider splitting in future
- AI disclosure badge uses AIDisclosureBadge component with compact variant
- Cookie documentation uses camelCase keys (theme, consent, visitorId, csrfToken, simulatedTier)
