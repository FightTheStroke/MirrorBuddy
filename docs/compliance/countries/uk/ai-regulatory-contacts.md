## Primary AI Oversight

**AI Safety Institute (AISI)**

- Role: Government body for AI safety evaluation and research
- Website: https://www.aisi.gov.uk/
- Address: To be verified
- Note: AISI focuses on frontier AI safety; not a regulatory enforcement body

**Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)**

- Role: AI policy lead; publishes AI regulation white papers
- Website: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology

Note: The UK follows a sector-specific approach to AI regulation rather than a single AI authority.
Existing regulators apply AI rules within their domains.

## Data Protection Authority

**Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)**

### Data Protection Complaints (ICO)

2. Must first complain to the organization (MirrorBuddy) and wait for response
3. ICO complaint form requires: organization details, what happened, what response received
4. Expected response: ICO acknowledges within 5 working days
5. Investigation timeline: Varies; ICO prioritizes based on severity and public interest

### Rights Exercise

1. Contact MirrorBuddy DPO first: roberdan@fightthestroke.org
2. Allow up to 30 days for response (UK GDPR timeline)
3. If unsatisfied, file complaint with ICO
4. ICO can issue enforcement notices, fines up to £17.5M or 4% global turnover
