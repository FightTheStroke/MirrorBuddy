## UK AI Regulatory Framework

### Current Approach: "Principles-Based Regulation"

UK uses a flexible, **principles-based** approach rather than prescriptive rules:

**Key Principles for Educational AI:**

| Principle          | MirrorBuddy Application                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Transparency**   | Disclose AI use in learning recommendations |
| **Fairness**       | Audit for disability discrimination bias    |
| **Accountability** | Maintain audit logs of AI decisions         |
| **Safety**         | Implement human override capability         |
| **Privacy**        | UK GDPR compliance (enhanced for minors)    |

### Upcoming: AI Bill (Expected 2025-2026)

UK is developing statutory AI regulation framework. Current status:

- Draft legislation under review
- Expected to introduce mandatory risk assessment for high-risk AI
- Educational AI likely to be in "high-risk" category
- AISI UK will have expanded enforcement powers
