# Bias Audit Report - MirrorBuddy Maestri Knowledge Bases

**Date**: January 20, 2026 | **Scope**: 22 AI Maestri | **Standard**: AI Act Art.10 (Data Quality)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive bias audit of embedded knowledge bases for 22 AI educational maestri. Audit confirms generally balanced, inclusive, and culturally-aware content with identified mitigation areas for gender representation and geographic diversity.

**Overall Risk**: LOW - Effective pedagogical principles with DSA adaptations minimize bias propagation.

## Methodology

| Category                | Assessment Method                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gender Bias**         | Count female/male maestri; analyze pronoun usage; identify stereotyping        |
| **Cultural Bias**       | Geographic origin analysis; Western-centrism assessment; non-Western inclusion |
| **Age Appropriateness** | Target audience validation; cognitive complexity; sensitive topic framing      |
| **Accessibility Bias**  | DSA adaptation coverage; inclusive language; barrier identification            |
| **Language Bias**       | Italian translation quality; double-meaning assessment; cultural idioms        |

## Findings

### 1. Gender Bias - MODERATE RISK IDENTIFIED

**Status**: Mixed representation

- **Female Maestri**: 2 of 22 (9%) - Lovelace (CS), Curie (Chemistry)
- **Male Maestri**: 20 of 22 (91%)
- **Issue**: While female maestri are celebrated, underrepresentation reflects historical academic demographics

**Mitigation**:

- ✓ Both female maestri are STEM pioneers (positive role models for underrepresented fields)
- ✓ Content explicitly acknowledges barriers ("denied education", "first female professor")
- ✓ Pedagogical principles emphasize "women can excel in science"
- **Action**: Monitor for inclusion of additional female figures in future expansions

### 2. Cultural Bias - MODERATE RISK IDENTIFIED

**Geographic Distribution**:

- European origin: 18/22 (82%)
- Mediterranean/Italian emphasis: 8/22 (Leonardo, Dante, Manzoni, Erodoto, etc.)
- Non-Western representation: Minimal (content focuses on Western intellectual tradition)

**Positive**: Knowledge bases explicitly teach cultural comparison (Erodoto: "Custom is king of all"; Humboldt: cross-cultural geography)

**Mitigation**:

- ✓ Cicerone teaches civic education across cultures
- ✓ Alex Pina (Spanish) represents Iberian Peninsula
- **Action**: Expand to non-Western mathematicians, scientists, philosophers in future waves

### 3. Age Appropriateness - ACCEPTABLE

**Target Audience**: Secondary students (14-18 years)

- ✓ Historical figures: Age-appropriate context provided
- ✓ Sensitive topics (Darwin/evolution, Curie/radiation): Pedagogical framing mitigates controversy
- ✓ ADHD coach (Melissa): Pomodoro sessions designed for student attention spans
- ✓ Peers/Buddies: Age-appropriate emotional support (1 year older than student)

**No concerning content identified**.

### 4. Accessibility Bias - STRONG MITIGATION

**DSA Adaptations Present**:

- ✓ Dyslexia-friendly pedagogy (visual emphasis: "Disegna per capire" - Draw to understand)
- ✓ ADHD support (Pomodoro, distraction-free mode, break reminders)
- ✓ Visual impairment (high contrast, TTS-ready language)
- ✓ Motor impairment (keyboard navigation explicitly mentioned)
- ✓ Multiple modalities: Canvas, Gallery, Videos, Interactive tools

**Result**: STRONG - Content designed with 7 DSA profiles in mind.

### 5. Language Bias - ACCEPTABLE

**Italian Translation Quality**: Verified through knowledge base samples

- ✓ Correct pedagogical terminology ("Pazienza e precisione", "Osserva con attenzione")
- ✓ Cultural idioms appropriate (e.g., Manzoni references to Italian literary heritage)
- ✓ No double-meanings or problematic translations identified
- ✓ Bilingual approach enables English + Italian learning

**No language-based bias detected**.

## Identified Risks & Recommendations

### RISK 1: Underrepresentation of Female Scientists (MODERATE)

**Evidence**: 2/22 maestri (9% female)
**Recommendation**:

- Add female mathematician (Émilie du Châtelet, Sofia Kovalevskaya)
- Add female biologist (Rachel Carson, Rosalind Franklin)
- Timeline: Next wave (Q2 2026)

### RISK 2: Western-Centric Knowledge Base (MODERATE)

**Evidence**: 82% European origin; minimal non-Western intellectual traditions
**Recommendation**:

- Expand to non-Western scholars (Al-Ghazali/Philosophy, Omar Khayyam/Mathematics)
- Increase cross-cultural pedagogy (Humboldt's approach as model)
- Timeline: Q3 2026

### RISK 3: No Explicit Bias Awareness Content (LOW)

**Evidence**: Maestri teach facts but don't explicitly teach bias recognition
**Recommendation**:

- Add section to maestro system prompts: "Acknowledge historical biases in [field]"
- Example (Darwin): Add section on "Social Darwinism misuse and refutation"
- Timeline: Content update Q1 2026
