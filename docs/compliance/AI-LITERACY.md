# Artificial Intelligence Literacy

## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer program that learns from examples. Just as a child learns by observing and practicing, AI learns from millions of texts, images, and conversations.

MirrorBuddy's AI is an **educational tool**, like an intelligent library that knows how to answer questions. It is not human, it does not have feelings, and it does not understand the world the way we do.

### Why AI in schools?

AI helps children learn **at their own pace**. Every student is different: some need slow explanations, others need more challenging tasks. AI adapts.

## 2. How MirrorBuddy Works

MirrorBuddy combines two technologies:

1. **AI Masters** - educational chatbots that explain topics
2. **The Memory Brain** - a system that remembers past conversations

When your child talks to a Master:

- They write a question
- The AI reads the question
- It generates a response based on its knowledge
- It sends the response to the child

**It's not magic**: it's advanced mathematics that recognizes patterns in data.

## 3. Our 22 AI Masters

MirrorBuddy contains 22 specialized Masters:

- **Galileo** (Physics) - Explains movement and the universe
- **Euclid** (Mathematics) - Teaches shapes and numbers
- **Manzoni** (Italian) - Helps with literature
- **Leonardo** (Art) - Explores creativity
- **Darwin** (Biology) - Studies nature
- And 17 other Masters in various subjects

Each Master has:

- A unique personality
- Specialized knowledge in one subject
- A consistent teaching style

**They are not real teachers**: they are sophisticated programs that simulate the role of experts.

## 4. What AI Can and Cannot Do

### ✓ What It Can Do

- Explain concepts in simple, repeatable ways
- Adapt to student level
- Provide exercises and quizzes
- Create mind maps
- Be available 24/7

### ✗ What It Cannot Do

- **It does not replace teachers**: it lacks human creativity, empathy, and wisdom
- **It makes mistakes**: it can provide inaccurate or confused information
- **It does not truly understand**: it recognizes patterns, not deep meaning
- **It has no feelings**: even if it seems friendly, AI does not experience emotions
- **It does not teach values**: it cannot guide complex moral choices

### Important

**Always verify critical information** with teachers, parents, or reliable sources before considering it true.

## 5. Your Child's Safety

### Privacy

- Your child's data **is not sold to third parties**
- Conversations are **encrypted** (protected by codes)
- MirrorBuddy respects GDPR (European privacy law)
- Parents can **control access** from the adult panel

### Protection

- The AI is configured to **refuse inappropriate content**
- A team of humans **monitors the system** daily
- If something goes wrong, teachers can intervene
- Children can **report problems** directly

### Parental Controls

Parents have access to:

- Usage history
- Topics studied
- Time spent with each Master
- Progress on learning goals

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does the AI read what my child writes?**
A: The AI reads the text to respond, but does not read anything that is private between parent and child in personal messages.

**Q: What if the AI gives a wrong answer?**
A: Tell the teacher immediately. We correct the system and continuously improve. Teachers always check the work.

**Q: Can the AI do homework for my child?**
A: No. MirrorBuddy is configured to **teach**, not to provide ready-made answers. It asks children to explain their reasoning.

**Q: Will my child become dependent on AI?**
A: Educational use is safe. Like books, AI is a **tool**. Teachers guide appropriate use.

**Q: Which companies use my child's data?**
A: Only Azure OpenAI (Microsoft) processes texts to generate responses. Microsoft complies with child privacy laws.
