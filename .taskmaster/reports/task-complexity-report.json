			"taskTitle": "Improve Floating Voice Button Positioning with SafeAreaInset",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactor into: (1) auditing all fixed padding usages, (2) integrating SafeAreaInset utilities for both iOS and Android, (3) implementing responsive positioning for orientation and edge cases, (4) adding orientation and keyboard visibility listeners, and (5) updating animations and validating accessibility.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires cross-platform UI refactoring, dynamic layout logic, and robust device/orientation handling. It involves both iOS and Android platform specifics, must account for edge cases (notches, keyboard, split-screen), and requires thorough device and accessibility testing. While not algorithmically complex, the breadth of device scenarios and the need for regression-proofing and accessibility validation elevate its complexity above a simple UI tweak."
