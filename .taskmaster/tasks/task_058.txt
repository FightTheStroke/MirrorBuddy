# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement User-Friendly Error Messages and Recovery Actions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create clear, non-technical error messages and provide actionable recovery options such as retry buttons and fallback indicators.
### Details:
Design error messages that use plain language, avoiding technical jargon. Place messages close to the error source and use icons or highlights for visibility. Implement retry buttons for failed operations and display fallback strategy indicators where appropriate. Ensure error messages do not obscure user input and allow users to easily attempt recovery actions. Follow accessibility guidelines for color and contrast.

Implemented ErrorBannerView.swift, a comprehensive error display system with recovery actions. The component features user-friendly error messages in Italian with category-specific titles, icon-based visual hierarchy, and color coding (orange/red/yellow/gray). Includes retry functionality with countdown displays for rate-limited operations and automatic retry delay information. Fallback indicators show error severity through color coding and category icons, with expandable details sections containing recovery suggestions. Recovery actions include prominent retry buttons with accessibility hints, help documentation links, and smooth animations for dismissal and expansion. Full accessibility support includes VoiceOver compatibility, WCAG-compliant high contrast colors, and Dynamic Type support. The visual design follows Material Design principles with rounded corners, shadows, spring animations, dark mode support, and error-specific color theming. Implementation includes an .errorBanner() view modifier for easy integration with automatic positioning and smooth transitions. Build status is complete with 6 comprehensive previews.

## 2. Integrate Help/Support and Feedback Mechanisms for Error Situations [done]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Add contextual help links, a support section, and user feedback collection to assist users in resolving errors and reporting issues.
### Details:
Provide contextual help documentation linked directly from error messages. Add a dedicated help/support section accessible from error dialogs. Implement a feedback form or prompt that appears after error events, allowing users to report issues or suggest improvements. Ensure the support and feedback features are easy to access and use, and that user input is routed to the appropriate support channels.

## 3. Implement Automatic Recovery and Developer-Focused Error Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Enable automatic recovery for common errors, add debug logging for developers, and create an error reporting mechanism for diagnostics.
### Details:
Identify common recoverable errors and implement automatic retry or fallback logic where feasible. Add debug logging that captures error details for developer use (not visible to end users). Create an error reporting mechanism that collects relevant diagnostic information and sends it to a backend or logging service for analysis. Ensure user privacy and security in all reporting features.
