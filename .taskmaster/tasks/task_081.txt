# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and configure the MirrorBuddy app icon for all platforms (iPhone, iPad, macOS) following iOS Human Interface Guidelines and accessibility best practices.
# Details:
1. Design app icon concept:
   - Represent app purpose (study assistance, mind mapping, learning)
   - Use mirror/reflection theme combined with educational elements
   - High contrast and clear shapes for accessibility
   - Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for app icons

2. Generate or create icon:
   - Can use AI tools like DALL-E 3 for generation
   - Ensure 1024x1024 base resolution
   - Test appearance on different backgrounds

3. Create all required icon sizes:
   - App Store: 1024x1024
   - iPhone: 180x180, 120x120, 87x87, 80x80, 58x58, 60x60, 40x40
   - iPad: 167x167, 152x152, 76x76
   - macOS: 512x512, 256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 32x32, 16x16

4. Add to project:
   - Place in Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset
   - Update Contents.json with all sizes
   - Remove alpha channel if present

5. Test and verify:
   - Build and run on simulator
   - Test on physical devices if available
   - Verify appearance in Settings, Spotlight, etc.

6. Document design rationale in project docs

# Test Strategy:
Visual verification: Build app and verify icon appears correctly in simulator and on device. Check icon in multiple contexts: Home screen, Settings, Spotlight search, App Switcher. Verify all required sizes are present and correctly referenced in Contents.json.
