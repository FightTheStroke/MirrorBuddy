# Task ID: 104
# Title: Integrate ContextBannerView into Dashboard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 32 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add ContextBannerView to the top of the ScrollView in MainTabView.swift to provide persistent context awareness of active subject and material across all dashboard interactions.
# Details:
1. Locate the ScrollView in MainTabView.swift at line 62 where there is currently empty space.

2. Import the ContextBannerView component if not already imported:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MainTabView: View {
    // Existing code...
```

3. Add the ContextBannerView at the top of the ScrollView:
```swift
ScrollView {
    VStack(spacing: 16) {
        ContextBannerView() // Add this line
        
        // Existing content...
    }
    .padding()
}
```

4. Ensure the ContextBannerView displays the current context information:
   - Active subject (name, color)
   - Current material being studied
   - Any other relevant context information

5. Style the ContextBannerView to match the dashboard design:
   - Use appropriate padding and spacing
   - Ensure text is readable and accessible
   - Apply consistent color scheme

6. Make sure the ContextBannerView remains visible at the top of the ScrollView even when scrolling down.

7. Test the implementation on different device sizes to ensure proper layout and visibility.

8. Verify that the context information updates correctly when the user switches subjects or materials in other parts of the app.

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual inspection:
   - Verify ContextBannerView appears at the top of the ScrollView in MainTabView
   - Confirm it displays the correct subject and material information
   - Check that styling is consistent with app design

2. Functional testing:
   - Change the active subject in the app and verify the banner updates accordingly
   - Change the active material and verify the banner reflects the change
   - Test navigation between tabs to ensure context persistence

3. UI testing:
   - Test on different device sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad)
   - Verify the banner is visible and properly sized on all devices
   - Check that the banner doesn't overlap with other UI elements

4. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify text contrast meets accessibility standards
   - Test with VoiceOver to ensure context information is properly announced
   - Check that the banner works with Dynamic Type settings

5. Performance testing:
   - Verify that adding the banner doesn't cause performance issues
   - Check that scrolling remains smooth with the banner in place
