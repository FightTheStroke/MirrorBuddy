# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement PDF Text Extraction with VisionKit
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to extract text from PDF files using VisionKit OCR.
# Details:
1. Implement PDF loading and rendering
2. Use VisionKit for OCR text extraction
3. Process PDF pages in parallel for speed
4. Extract text structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
5. Preserve text formatting information
6. Handle multi-column layouts
7. Extract images from PDFs
8. Create a structured document model from extracted content

# Test Strategy:
Test text extraction with various PDF types. Verify structure extraction works correctly. Test performance with large PDFs. Verify multi-column handling works properly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement PDF Loading and Rendering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functionality to load PDF files and render them for processing with VisionKit.
### Details:
Implement PDF document loading using PDFKit. Create a rendering pipeline that converts PDF pages to images at appropriate resolution for OCR. Handle large PDFs efficiently with pagination. Implement caching mechanism for rendered pages to improve performance. Support various PDF formats and versions.

## 2. Implement VisionKit OCR Text Extraction [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Use VisionKit to perform OCR on rendered PDF pages and extract raw text content.
### Details:
Integrate VisionKit's OCR capabilities to process rendered PDF pages. Implement VNRecognizeTextRequest with appropriate recognition level settings. Process PDF pages in parallel using DispatchGroup for improved performance. Handle text recognition errors and implement retry mechanisms. Extract text with position information for layout reconstruction.

## 3. Create Structured Document Model [done]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Process extracted text to identify structure elements and create a hierarchical document model.
### Details:
Analyze text position and formatting to identify headings, paragraphs, and lists. Implement algorithms to detect multi-column layouts and preserve reading order. Extract text formatting information (bold, italic, font size) when available. Identify and extract embedded images from PDFs. Create a structured document model that preserves the semantic hierarchy and can be used by other application components.
