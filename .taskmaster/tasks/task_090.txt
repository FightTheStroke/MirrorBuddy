# Task ID: 90
# Title: Integrate Voice Coach for Guided Problem Solving
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 89 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable voice-guided problem solving, linking screen capture, AI analysis, and visual/voice feedback.
# Details:
This task has been verified as already implemented via VisionVoiceInteractionService (Task 37) and HomeworkHelpView. The implementation includes voice command trigger ('Aiutami con questo'), screen capture, AI analysis, visual annotations, and voice guidance synthesis.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the existing implementation: voice command → capture → analyze → explain. Confirm that the VisionVoiceInteractionService and HomeworkHelpView correctly handle the entire workflow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Voice Command Trigger for Guided Problem Solving [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and integrate a voice command trigger ('Aiutami con questo') to initiate the guided problem-solving workflow.
### Details:
Use a speech recognition library to detect the specific trigger phrase. Ensure the trigger is responsive and works in various noise conditions. Integrate with the app's main UI to listen for the command only when appropriate.

## 2. Chain Screen Capture and AI Analysis upon Voice Trigger [done]
### Dependencies: 90.1
### Description: Automatically capture the current screen and send it to the AI analysis module when the voice command is detected.
### Details:
Implement screen capture functionality that activates immediately after the voice trigger. Ensure the captured image is correctly formatted and securely transmitted to the AI analysis backend. Handle errors gracefully if capture or transmission fails.

## 3. Generate and Overlay Visual Annotations Based on AI Analysis [done]
### Dependencies: 90.2
### Description: Display visual annotations on the captured screen image to highlight key problem areas and AI-generated insights.
### Details:
Parse AI analysis results to determine annotation locations and content. Overlay highlights, arrows, or text on the screen image. Ensure annotations are clear, non-intrusive, and visually consistent with app design.

## 4. Synthesize and Play Voice Guidance for Problem Explanation [done]
### Dependencies: 90.3
### Description: Convert AI-generated explanations into synthesized speech and play them to guide the user through the problem-solving process.
### Details:
Use a text-to-speech engine to generate natural-sounding voice guidance from AI explanations. Synchronize voice playback with visual annotations. Provide controls for pausing, replaying, or stopping the guidance.

## 5. Document Existing Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 90.4
### Description: Document the existing implementation of the Voice Coach feature in VisionVoiceInteractionService and HomeworkHelpView.
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation of the existing implementation, including the processVoiceCommand() function, startSession() method, speak() method with AVSpeechSynthesizer, session management with conversation history, integration with VisionAnalysisService, and the HomeworkHelpView UI components.

## 6. Verify Integration with Related Services [done]
### Dependencies: 90.5
### Description: Confirm that the Voice Coach feature properly integrates with all related services and components.
### Details:
Verify that the Voice Coach feature correctly integrates with VisionAnalysisService for homework analysis, camera functionality, and any other related components. Ensure that the integration points are robust and handle edge cases appropriately.
