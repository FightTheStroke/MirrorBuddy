# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Parallel Material Processing Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a pipeline to process study materials in parallel for maximum efficiency.
# Details:
1. Design a processing pipeline architecture
2. Implement parallel processing using Swift concurrency
3. Create a task coordinator for managing subtasks
4. Implement progress tracking and reporting
5. Add error handling and recovery
6. Optimize for performance and battery usage
7. Implement processing queue for multiple materials
8. Add background processing using BGProcessingTask

# Test Strategy:
Test pipeline with various material types. Measure processing time improvements. Test error recovery with simulated failures. Verify background processing works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Processing Pipeline Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive architecture for the parallel material processing pipeline that defines components, data flow, and concurrency model.
### Details:
Design a modular pipeline architecture with clear input/output interfaces. Define processing stages including material parsing, content extraction, metadata generation, and storage. Create diagrams showing data flow and concurrency patterns. Document the architecture with performance considerations and scalability options.

## 2. Implement Swift Concurrency for Parallel Processing [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Develop the core parallel processing functionality using Swift's modern concurrency features like async/await and task groups.
### Details:
Implement async processing functions for each pipeline stage. Create task groups to process multiple materials concurrently. Use actors to manage shared state safely. Implement proper cancellation handling. Create throttling mechanisms to prevent system overload. Use structured concurrency patterns to maintain clean task hierarchies.

## 3. Create Task Coordinator and Progress Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Develop a coordinator component that manages processing tasks and provides detailed progress reporting.
### Details:
Implement a TaskCoordinator class that manages the lifecycle of processing tasks. Create a progress tracking system with support for overall and per-task progress. Implement a notification system for progress updates. Add support for pausing and resuming tasks. Create a dashboard UI for monitoring active processing tasks with detailed statistics.

## 4. Implement Error Handling and Background Processing [done]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Add robust error handling, recovery mechanisms, and support for background processing using BGProcessingTask.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for all pipeline stages. Create recovery strategies for common failure scenarios. Develop a retry mechanism with exponential backoff. Implement BGProcessingTask integration for background execution. Add persistence for task state to survive app termination. Create a processing queue that prioritizes tasks appropriately. Optimize for battery efficiency during background processing.
