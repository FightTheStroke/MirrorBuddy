# Task ID: 111
# Title: Implement Voice Command Navigation for Study Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 57 (Not found), 63 (Not found), 64 (Not found), 78 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the navigation logic for voice commands to switch to the Study tab and open relevant views like Study mode, Flashcard review, and Mind Map viewing.
# Details:
1. Locate and update the handleStartStudy, handleReviewFlashcards, and handleViewMindMap functions in the voice command handler
2. Implement tab switching logic to navigate to the Study tab using TabView selection state
3. Add navigation to specific study views based on the command:
   - For handleStartStudy: Navigate to the study session view with the current material
   - For handleReviewFlashcards: Navigate to the flashcard review interface
   - For handleViewMindMap: Navigate to the mind map visualization view
4. Ensure proper state management to maintain context during navigation
5. Add error handling for cases where navigation can't be completed (e.g., no active material)
6. Implement feedback mechanisms to confirm successful navigation via voice
7. Add logging for voice navigation actions for analytics
8. Ensure navigation works in both online and offline modes
9. Update voice command help documentation to reflect new navigation capabilities

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each voice command (start study, review flashcards, view mind map) to verify correct navigation
2. Verify tab switching works properly when in different app sections
3. Test navigation with various study materials to ensure context is maintained
4. Test edge cases like issuing commands when no study material is selected
5. Verify appropriate feedback is provided to the user after navigation
6. Test voice command navigation in offline mode
7. Verify accessibility features work correctly during voice navigation
8. Test performance to ensure navigation occurs without noticeable delay
9. Conduct user testing with various accents and speech patterns
