# Task ID: 82
# Title: Implement Localization Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3 (Not found), 4 (Not found), 5 (Not found), 6 (Not found), 7 (Not found), 8 (Not found)
# Priority: critical
# Description: Set up complete localization infrastructure for Italian (PRIMARY/DEFAULT) and English, with support for additional languages. MUST be done before UI implementation.
# Details:
1. Create Localizable.xcstrings catalog:
   - Add Italian (it) as base language
   - Add English (en) as secondary language
   - Configure for future language additions

2. Extract all hardcoded UI strings:
   - ContentView and all views
   - Model descriptions (Subject names, Achievement descriptions, etc.)
   - Button labels, navigation titles, accessibility labels
   - Error messages and alerts

3. Convert to localized strings:
   - Use String catalogs (Xcode 15+) or .strings files
   - Group by feature/screen for organization
   - Include context comments for translators

4. Update all SwiftUI views:
   - Replace hardcoded Text("...") with Text(verbatim:) or Text(LocalizedStringKey(...))
   - Use .accessibilityLabel with localized strings
   - Test language switching

5. Add language selector in Settings:
   - Show current language
   - Allow switching between Italian and English
   - Persist preference in UserDefaults

6. Document localization workflow:
   - How to add new languages
   - How to add new strings
   - Translation guidelines

# Test Strategy:
Switch between Italian and English in Settings and verify all UI text changes correctly. Use Xcode scheme language options to test different languages. Verify accessibility labels are localized. Check that no hardcoded strings remain in the UI.
