# Task ID: 112
# Title: Implement Voice Command Material Detail Navigation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 28 (Not found), 57 (Not found), 111 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the navigation logic for voice commands to open specific study materials by their ID in the MaterialDetailView when users issue voice commands.
# Details:
1. Locate the handleOpenMaterial function in the voice command handler that currently accepts a materialID parameter
2. Implement the logic to find the material by ID in the data store (likely using SwiftData query)
3. Once the material is found, implement navigation to the MaterialDetailView with the selected material
4. Add state management to trigger the navigation from the voice command context to the detail view
5. Ensure the navigation works from any tab or view in the application
6. Handle edge cases such as:
   - Material not found (provide voice feedback)
   - Invalid material ID format
   - Navigation while already in detail view (refresh or provide feedback)
7. Add logging for analytics to track voice command usage
8. Ensure the implementation maintains accessibility support during navigation
9. Optimize the material lookup for performance to minimize delay between command and navigation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test voice commands with various material IDs to verify correct navigation
2. Verify navigation works from different app contexts (home screen, study tab, settings, etc.)
3. Test edge cases including:
   - Non-existent material IDs
   - Navigation while already viewing the requested material
   - Rapid sequential commands
4. Measure and verify the response time between command and navigation completion
5. Test with VoiceOver enabled to ensure accessibility is maintained
6. Verify proper error handling and user feedback when material cannot be found
7. Test with offline mode to ensure cached materials can be accessed via voice commands
