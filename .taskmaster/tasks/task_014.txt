# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement API Error Handling and Retry Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11 (Not found), 12 (Not found), 13 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust error handling and retry mechanism for all API clients.
# Details:
1. Create a unified APIError enum for all possible error types
2. Implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. Create a RetryableTask protocol for retryable operations
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints
5. Add logging for all API errors
6. Create user-friendly error messages
7. Implement fallback strategies for critical operations
8. Add analytics for error tracking

# Test Strategy:
Test retry logic with simulated failures. Verify exponential backoff works correctly. Test circuit breaker functionality. Verify fallback strategies execute properly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Unified API Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a standardized error handling system for all API clients, including a unified APIError enum and structured error responses.
### Details:
Define a comprehensive APIError enum covering all possible error types. Implement middleware or centralized logic to ensure all API responses use a consistent, machine-readable error structure with clear, human-readable messages. Follow best practices such as using appropriate HTTP status codes, avoiding exposure of sensitive data, and including contextual information for debugging. Ensure error payloads include error codes, messages, and optional documentation links.

## 2. Implement Exponential Backoff Retry and RetryableTask Protocol [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop a robust retry mechanism using exponential backoff and define a protocol for retryable operations.
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff logic for retrying transient API errors (e.g., 429, 503), ensuring retries are capped and respect server-provided Retry-After headers. Create a RetryableTask protocol or interface that standardizes how retryable operations are defined and executed. Integrate this logic into all API clients, ensuring idempotency where required.

## 3. Integrate Circuit Breaker, Fallbacks, and Error Analytics [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Add circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints, implement fallback strategies, and integrate error logging and analytics.
### Details:
Implement a circuit breaker mechanism to prevent repeated calls to failing endpoints, with configurable thresholds and recovery logic. Develop fallback strategies for critical operations, such as returning cached data or user-friendly error messages when services are unavailable. Add comprehensive logging for all API errors and integrate analytics to track error rates, types, and resolution times.
