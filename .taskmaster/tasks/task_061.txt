# Test Strategy:
Use XCTest framework for unit testing. Create mock objects for dependencies. Test edge cases and error conditions. Measure code coverage with XcodeCov.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Unit Tests for SwiftData Models [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for all SwiftData models to ensure data integrity and proper functionality.
### Details:
Write tests for model initialization, validation, relationships, and persistence. Include tests for edge cases like empty values, maximum length values, and invalid inputs. Verify that model migrations work correctly.

## 2. Create Unit Tests for API Clients [done]
### Dependencies: 61.1
### Description: Develop unit tests for all API client classes to ensure proper communication with external services.
### Details:
Implement tests for request formation, response parsing, error handling, and retry logic. Mock network responses to test success and failure scenarios. Verify authentication flows and token refresh mechanisms.

## 3. Add Unit Tests for Processing Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 61.1, 61.2
### Description: Create tests for the data processing pipeline to ensure correct transformation and handling of information.
### Details:
Test each step of the processing pipeline individually and as an integrated flow. Verify that data transformations maintain integrity. Test error propagation and recovery mechanisms throughout the pipeline.

## 4. Implement Tests for Voice and Vision Features [done]
### Dependencies: 61.2, 61.3
### Description: Develop unit tests for voice recognition and computer vision components to ensure accurate processing.
### Details:
Create tests for voice command parsing, speech-to-text accuracy, and vision analysis algorithms. Mock input data for consistent testing. Verify that feature flags correctly enable/disable functionality.

## 5. Create Tests for Mind Map Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 61.3
### Description: Develop unit tests for the mind map generation algorithms and visualization components.
### Details:
Test node creation, relationship mapping, layout algorithms, and visualization rendering. Verify that mind maps correctly represent the underlying data model. Test performance with large mind maps.

## 6. Add Tests for Task Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 61.1
### Description: Implement unit tests for the task management functionality including creation, updates, and status tracking.
### Details:
Test task creation, modification, deletion, and status transitions. Verify dependency tracking between tasks. Test sorting and filtering algorithms. Ensure notifications work correctly for task deadlines.

## 7. Implement Tests for Gamification System [done]
### Dependencies: 61.6
### Description: Create unit tests for the gamification features including points, badges, and progress tracking.
### Details:
Test point calculation algorithms, achievement unlocking logic, and progress tracking. Verify that gamification rules are applied consistently. Test level progression and reward distribution.

## 8. Create Tests for Offline Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 61.1, 61.2, 61.3
### Description: Develop unit tests for offline capabilities including data caching and synchronization.
### Details:
Test offline data access, modification, and queuing for synchronization. Verify that the app gracefully handles network transitions. Test conflict resolution during synchronization after offline changes.

## 9. Set Up Code Coverage Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 61.1, 61.2, 61.3, 61.4, 61.5, 61.6, 61.7, 61.8
### Description: Configure code coverage tools and establish baseline metrics to track testing progress toward 80% coverage goal.
### Details:
Set up XcodeCov or similar tool to measure code coverage. Create reports to identify untested code paths. Establish coverage thresholds for CI/CD pipeline. Document testing gaps and prioritize areas for additional tests.

Implemented comprehensive code coverage monitoring system with the following components:

1. scripts/run-tests-with-coverage.sh (2.6KB)
   - Runs xcodebuild test with -enableCodeCoverage YES
   - Cleans DerivedData before running
   - Supports xcpretty for formatted output
   - Automatically generates coverage report after tests
   - Shows pass/fail status and coverage target comparison

2. scripts/generate-coverage-report.sh (4.4KB)
   - Extracts coverage data using xcrun xccov
   - Generates JSON report (coverage-reports/coverage.json)
   - Generates text report (coverage-reports/coverage.txt)
   - Calculates overall line coverage percentage
   - Compares against 80% target goal
   - Generates SVG coverage badge with color coding
   - Python3-based analysis for detailed metrics

3. Docs/CODE_COVERAGE.md documenting:
   - How to run tests with coverage (3 methods)
   - How to view coverage reports
   - Coverage goals by component (Models 90%+, APIs 85%+, etc.)
   - Best practices for improving coverage
   - CI/CD integration guidelines
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Coverage monitoring over time

The system features 80% line coverage target, color-coded output, badge generation, JSON output for CI/CD, component-level analysis, and quality gate enforcement. Scripts are executable with simple usage commands and comprehensive documentation.
