# Task ID: 72
# Title: Implement Background Tasks for Scheduled Syncs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17 (Not found), 18 (Not found), 25 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Create background tasks for scheduled material syncs at 13:00 and 18:00 CET.
# Details:
1. Register BGProcessingTask for background execution
2. Implement scheduling logic for 13:00 and 18:00 CET
3. Create sync task implementation
4. Add completion handling and error recovery
5. Implement power and network efficiency
6. Create notification for sync completion
7. Add manual trigger option
8. Implement logging for background execution

# Test Strategy:
Test scheduled execution at specified times. Verify sync completes successfully in background. Test error recovery in background mode. Measure power and network usage during background sync.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Register and Configure Background Processing Task [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the BGProcessingTask for scheduled material syncs with proper registration and configuration.
### Details:
Implement BGProcessingTask registration in the app delegate or scene delegate. Configure the task identifier in Info.plist with proper background modes. Set up the task request with appropriate resource requirements (network, processing time). Implement the handler for task execution that will contain the sync logic. Add proper task expiration handling.

## 2. Implement Scheduling Logic for Fixed Times [done]
### Dependencies: 72.1
### Description: Create scheduling mechanism to trigger syncs at 13:00 and 18:00 CET regardless of user's timezone.
### Details:
Calculate next execution times based on current time and target times (13:00 and 18:00 CET). Convert CET times to user's local timezone for proper scheduling. Implement persistent scheduling that survives app restarts. Add logic to reschedule tasks after completion. Create a mechanism to avoid duplicate task scheduling. Implement date handling that accounts for daylight saving time changes.

## 3. Implement Sync Task with Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 72.1, 72.2
### Description: Create the core sync implementation with proper error handling, completion notification, and power efficiency.
### Details:
Implement the actual sync logic that will run in the background. Add comprehensive error handling with appropriate recovery strategies. Implement network efficiency by checking connection quality before sync. Add power efficiency by monitoring battery levels and adjusting sync behavior. Create user notifications for sync completion and errors. Implement detailed logging for background execution. Add manual trigger option in the app's settings. Create a retry mechanism for failed syncs with exponential backoff.
