# Task ID: 105
# Title: Refactor or Remove Quick Actions Section
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3 (Not found), 4 (Not found), 44 (Not found), 55 (Not found)
# Priority: low
# Description: Evaluate and implement improvements to the "Azioni rapide" (Quick Actions) section by either creating a dynamic carousel based on user context or removing the section if it provides limited value.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current implementation of Quick Actions in MainTabView.swift:110
2. Evaluate two possible approaches:
   a. Dynamic carousel approach:
      - Create a QuickActionProvider service that determines relevant actions based on:
        * Recent materials the user has accessed
        * Tasks with upcoming deadlines
        * Calendar events in the next 24-48 hours
      - Design a horizontally scrollable carousel UI component
      - Implement action buttons with appropriate icons and labels
      - Add animations for smooth transitions when actions change
      - Ensure actions are contextually relevant to Mario's workflow
   
   b. Removal approach:
      - Assess the current usage and value of the section
      - Consider user testing to determine if the section is helpful
      - If removing, ensure proper UI adjustments to maintain visual balance
      - Update spacing and layout to compensate for the removed section

3. Implementation details:
   - If implementing dynamic carousel:
     ```swift
     struct QuickAction {
         let id: UUID = UUID()
         let title: String
         let icon: String // SF Symbol name
         let action: () -> Void
         let badgeCount: Int?
     }
     
     class QuickActionProvider {
         func getRelevantActions() -> [QuickAction] {
             // Logic to determine contextually relevant actions
             // based on app state, user history, and upcoming events
         }
     }
     
     struct QuickActionsCarousel: View {
         @StateObject private var provider = QuickActionProvider()
         @State private var actions: [QuickAction] = []
         
         var body: some View {
             ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
                 HStack(spacing: 12) {
                     ForEach(actions, id: \.id) { action in
                         Button(action: action.action) {
                             VStack {
                                 Image(systemName: action.icon)
                                     .font(.system(size: 24))
                                 Text(action.title)
                                     .font(.caption)
                             }
                             .padding()
                             .background(Color.secondarySystemBackground)
                             .cornerRadius(12)
                             .overlay(
                                 action.badgeCount != nil ?
                                 BadgeView(count: action.badgeCount!) : nil
                             )
                         }
                     }
                 }
                 .padding(.horizontal)
             }
             .onAppear {
                 actions = provider.getRelevantActions()
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. Decision criteria:
   - Conduct a brief user test with 3-5 users to determine if quick actions are useful
   - Analyze app analytics to see if current static buttons are being used
   - Consider Mario's workflow and whether contextual actions would improve efficiency
   - Make final implementation decision based on findings

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional testing:
   - If implementing dynamic carousel:
     * Verify that actions update based on user context
     * Test that tapping each action performs the expected function
     * Confirm that the carousel properly handles different numbers of actions
     * Test horizontal scrolling behavior on different device sizes
     * Verify badge counts update correctly

   - If removing the section:
     * Verify that the UI layout adjusts properly without the section
     * Confirm that no functionality is lost or that alternatives exist
     * Test that navigation flows remain intuitive

2. User experience testing:
   - Conduct A/B testing with both implementations
   - Gather feedback on which approach better serves Mario's workflow
   - Measure time-to-task completion with and without quick actions
   - Observe natural usage patterns to determine if quick actions are discovered and used

3. Performance testing:
   - Measure any impact on app startup time
   - Test scrolling performance of the carousel with many items
   - Verify that dynamic content loading doesn't cause UI jank

4. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify VoiceOver compatibility
   - Test dynamic text size support
   - Confirm touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44Ã—44pt)

5. Integration testing:
   - Verify that the implementation works correctly with the rest of the dashboard
   - Test that state changes in other parts of the app are reflected in quick actions
