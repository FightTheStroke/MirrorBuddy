# Task ID: 91
# Title: Implement Extended Voice Recording (6 Hours, Background Mode)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Support up to 6 hours of continuous audio recording, with background operation and auto-save every 30 minutes.
# Details:
Use AVAudioRecorder with background mode. Compress audio in real-time to AAC (64 kbps). Implement auto-save and low battery warning. Add controls for start/stop, pause/resume, timer, battery indicator.

# Test Strategy:
Record for 6 hours, test background operation, auto-save, and low battery warning. Check file size and audio quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure AVAudioRecorder with background mode [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the AVAudioRecorder with proper configuration to support background recording and audio session management.
### Details:
Implement AVAudioRecorder with background audio capability. Configure audio session category to .playAndRecord with .allowsRecordingDuringBackgroundTasks option. Set up proper audio format with AAC compression at 64 kbps. Request necessary permissions in Info.plist for background audio. Handle audio interruptions and route changes.

## 2. Implement auto-save functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 91.1
### Description: Create a mechanism to automatically save recording progress every 30 minutes to prevent data loss.
### Details:
Implement a timer that triggers every 30 minutes to save the current recording. Create a file management system to handle multiple recording segments. Implement seamless continuation of recording after auto-save. Add metadata to track recording segments. Ensure auto-save works in background mode without interrupting recording.

## 3. Develop battery monitoring and low battery warning [done]
### Dependencies: 91.1
### Description: Create a system to monitor battery levels and warn users when battery is low during recording.
### Details:
Implement UIDevice battery monitoring. Create a threshold-based warning system (e.g., warnings at 20%, 10%, 5%). Design and implement a non-intrusive UI for battery warnings. Add automatic recording save when battery is critically low. Implement power-saving mode options for extended recording.

## 4. Build recording control UI [done]
### Dependencies: 91.1
### Description: Create user interface elements for controlling the recording process including start/stop, pause/resume, and timer display.
### Details:
Design and implement UI controls for recording: start/stop button, pause/resume button, elapsed time display, recording indicator. Add visual feedback for recording states. Implement accessibility features for all controls. Create animations for state transitions. Ensure controls are usable in both light and dark mode.

Implemented ExtendedVoiceRecordingView with comprehensive UI controls for extended classroom recording.

Implementation details:
- Created SwiftUI view with start/stop, pause/resume buttons
- Implemented animated recording indicator with red pulse effect
- Added elapsed time display with monospaced digits formatting
- Created battery level indicator with color-coded warnings (green>75%, orange>25%, red<20%)
- Full VoiceOver accessibility: all controls have descriptive labels and hints
- Italian localization: "Inizia", "Ferma", "Pausa", "Riprendi", "Registrazione in Corso", etc.
- Light/dark mode support via adaptive colors
- Permission handling: shows alert if microphone access denied with link to Settings
- Active recording protection: confirms before dismissing view if recording in progress
- Haptic feedback on start/stop actions

UI Components:
- Recording status indicator (gray/orange/red circle with icon)
- Timer display (HH:MM:SS format, 48pt bold rounded)
- Battery indicator (icon + percentage, only visible during recording)
- Control buttons: Pause/Resume (70x70pt orange), Start/Stop (90x90pt blue-purple gradient or red)
- Background gradient adjusts based on recording state

Accessibility:
- All buttons have accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint
- Timer has descriptive label "Durata registrazione: HH:MM:SS"
- Battery indicator combined as single accessible element
- Recording state communicated: "Non in registrazione", "Registrazione in pausa", "Registrazione in corso"

Preview states created:
- Idle (not recording)
- Recording (active, 2:05 elapsed)
- Paused (30:45 elapsed, 42% battery)
- Low Battery (1:30:32 elapsed, 15% battery warning)

Files created:
- MirrorBuddy/Features/Voice/Views/ExtendedVoiceRecordingView.swift (350 lines)

Testing:
- Build succeeded on IpadDiMario simulator
- All preview states render correctly
- VoiceOver labels verified in accessibility inspector
- Italian strings all properly localized

## 5. Implement extended recording session management [done]
### Dependencies: 91.1, 91.2, 91.3, 91.4
### Description: Create a robust system to manage extended recording sessions up to 6 hours with proper error handling and resource management.
### Details:
Implement session management to handle 6-hour recordings. Create a file merging system to combine auto-saved segments. Add error recovery mechanisms for unexpected interruptions. Implement memory management to prevent crashes during long sessions. Add recording statistics (file size, duration, quality). Create notification for recording completion. Implement recording cleanup for failed or abandoned sessions.
<info added on 2025-10-15T18:40:26.646Z>
Implemented comprehensive session management for 6-hour recordings with the following components:

1. File Merging System:
- mergeRecordingSegments() using AVComposition to combine backup segments
- Sorts backups by filename, adds in chronological order
- Uses AVAssetExportSession with M4A preset
- Cleans up original segments after successful merge
- Returns single merged file URL

2. Backup Segment Tracking:
- backupSegments array tracks all auto-saved files
- Updated on each auto-save (every 30 minutes)
- Passed to merge function on stop recording
- All segments cleaned up after merge completes

3. Memory Management:
- setupMemoryMonitoring() observes UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification
- handleMemoryWarning() triggers immediate auto-save to free memory
- Prevents crashes during long 6-hour sessions
- Weak self captures prevent retain cycles

4. Recording Statistics:
- RecordingStats struct with duration, fileSize, segmentCount, quality, sessionID
- Computed properties: fileSizeMB, formattedDuration, formattedFileSize
- getRecordingStatistics() returns current or final stats
- Published recordingStats property for UI display

5. Completion Notifications:
- sendCompletionNotification() sends UNNotification in Italian
- Smart duration formatting: "3h 25m" or "45 minuti"
- Sends immediately after recording stops

6. Abandoned Session Cleanup:
- cleanupAbandonedSessions() runs on service init
- Removes backup files older than 7 days from Recordings/Backups
- Prevents disk space bloat from incomplete recordings
- Logs cleanup actions

7. Error Recovery:
- Try/catch around segment merging with fallback to original files
- Skips invalid backup segments during merge
- Continues recording on auto-save failures
- Graceful handling of file system errors

Implementation added approximately 250 lines to ExtendedVoiceRecordingService.swift. Testing confirmed proper async/await isolation to @MainActor, memory warning handling, and compatibility with modern AVAsset APIs.
