# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Flashcard Generation with GPT-5 Nano
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 11, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to generate flashcards from study materials using GPT-5 nano.
# Details:
1. Create prompts for flashcard generation
2. Implement GPT-5 nano API calls
3. Parse API responses into Flashcard models
4. Generate appropriate number of cards based on content
5. Balance question difficulty
6. Create subject-specific flashcard templates
7. Store generated flashcards in SwiftData
8. Implement batch processing for efficiency

# Test Strategy:
Test flashcard generation with various subjects. Verify question quality and relevance. Test subject-specific templates. Measure performance with batch processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design flashcard data structure and API [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure of flashcards and create the API endpoints for generation and retrieval
### Details:
Create a data model for flashcards including fields for question, answer, tags, and difficulty level. Design API endpoints for generating flashcards from various content types and retrieving them. Document the API interface for integration with the frontend.

## 2. Implement GPT-5 Nano integration for flashcard generation [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Set up the connection to GPT-5 Nano API and create prompt templates for flashcard generation
### Details:
Establish connection to the GPT-5 Nano API. Create effective prompt templates that instruct the model to generate high-quality flashcards from input content. Implement error handling and retry logic for API calls. Optimize prompts for different types of content (text, articles, notes).

## 3. Develop quality control and testing framework [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Create a system to evaluate and improve the quality of generated flashcards
### Details:
Implement validation checks to ensure generated flashcards meet quality standards. Create a testing framework to evaluate flashcard effectiveness across different subjects. Develop a feedback mechanism to improve generation over time. Set up automated tests to verify the system works correctly with various inputs.
