# Task ID: 103
# Title: Implement Voice Commands and Feedback System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34, 101, 102
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate voice command functionality and feedback throughout the app, enabling voice-first navigation and interaction with all major features.
# Details:
1. Integrate VoiceCommandFeedbackView component:
   - Add to Dashboard, Materials, and Tasks screens
   - Display recognized commands in a non-intrusive overlay
   - Implement fade-in/fade-out animations for feedback visibility

2. Add VoiceCommandButton components:
   - Create reusable VoiceCommandButton component with visual feedback
   - Add to dashboard for quick actions ("Aggiornami", "Cosa devo studiare oggi?")
   - Implement long-press for extended voice command help

3. Implement voice command recognition system:
   - Create VoiceCommandManager class to handle recognition and routing
   - Define command patterns and intents (navigation, creation, query)
   - Implement fuzzy matching for natural language variations
   - Route recognized commands to appropriate features

4. Make major features voice-accessible:
   - Material navigation: "vai a matematica", "mostra i materiali di storia"
   - Task management: "crea un nuovo compito", "mostra i compiti di oggi"
   - Calendar viewing: "mostra il calendario", "cosa ho per luned√¨"
   - Mind map exploration: "apri le mappe mentali", "zoom sulla mappa"

5. Add haptic and audio feedback:
   - Implement subtle haptic feedback for command recognition
   - Add audio confirmation tones for successful commands
   - Create error feedback for unrecognized commands

6. Implement voice-first navigation:
   - Create NavigationManager extension for voice commands
   - Support commands like "vai a matematica", "apri le mappe mentali"
   - Implement context-aware navigation (relative to current screen)

7. Add voice dictation support:
   - Implement dictation mode for task creation
   - Add note-taking via dictation
   - Create editing commands for dictated content

8. Optimize for performance and accessibility:
   - Ensure voice commands work with VoiceOver enabled
   - Minimize battery impact during voice listening
   - Implement offline command recognition for basic navigation

# Test Strategy:
1. Create comprehensive test suite for voice command recognition:
   - Test each command pattern with multiple variations and accents
   - Verify correct routing of commands to appropriate features
   - Test in noisy environments to ensure reliability

2. Perform UI integration testing:
   - Verify VoiceCommandFeedbackView appears correctly on all screens
   - Test VoiceCommandButton functionality and visual feedback
   - Ensure haptic and audio feedback work as expected

3. Conduct navigation testing:
   - Test all voice-first navigation commands across the app
   - Verify context-aware navigation works correctly
   - Test navigation between deeply nested screens

4. Test dictation functionality:
   - Verify accurate transcription of dictated tasks and notes
   - Test editing commands during dictation
   - Measure dictation accuracy across different content types

5. Perform accessibility testing:
   - Verify voice commands work alongside VoiceOver
   - Test with different accessibility settings enabled
   - Ensure feedback is perceivable for users with disabilities

6. Conduct user testing:
   - Have test users try voice commands without prior instruction
   - Measure success rate of natural language commands
   - Gather feedback on command discoverability

7. Performance testing:
   - Measure battery impact during extended voice command usage
   - Test memory usage during continuous listening
   - Verify app responsiveness during voice processing
