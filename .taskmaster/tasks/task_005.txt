# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create SwiftData models for MindMap entity with nodes and relationships.
# Details:
Create a MindMap model with the following properties:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- title: String
- material: Relationship to Material entity
- nodes: Relationship to MindMapNode entities (to-many)
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date

Create a MindMapNode model with:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- text: String
- imageUrl: URL (optional)
- x: Double (position)
- y: Double (position)
- mindMap: Relationship to MindMap entity
- parentNode: Relationship to MindMapNode entity (optional)
- childNodes: Relationship to MindMapNode entities (to-many)

Implement proper relationships with cascade delete rules.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for MindMap and MindMapNode models. Test node creation, relationship establishment, and cascade delete functionality.
