# Task ID: 110
# Title: Implement Voice Command Sheets for Settings, Profile, and Help Views
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 63, 64
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create modal sheets for Settings, Profile, and Help views that respond to voice commands already handled by AppVoiceCommandHandler in MainTabView.
# Details:
1. Examine the existing AppVoiceCommandHandler to understand how showSettings, showProfile, and showHelp flags are currently set
2. Create three SwiftUI sheet views:
   - SettingsSheetView: Display app settings with appropriate controls
   - ProfileSheetView: Show user profile information and editing options
   - HelpSheetView: Provide help documentation and guidance
3. Modify MainTabView to bind these sheets to the corresponding boolean flags:
   ```swift
   .sheet(isPresented: $appVoiceCommandHandler.showSettings) {
       SettingsSheetView()
   }
   .sheet(isPresented: $appVoiceCommandHandler.showProfile) {
       ProfileSheetView()
   }
   .sheet(isPresented: $appVoiceCommandHandler.showHelp) {
       HelpSheetView()
   }
   ```
4. Ensure each sheet has a proper dismissal mechanism (both manual and voice-activated)
5. Add voice command handlers within each sheet for navigation
6. Implement accessibility features in all sheets
7. Add appropriate animations for sheet presentation
8. Update voice command documentation to include these new sheet interactions

# Test Strategy:
1. Test that voice commands "show settings", "show profile", and "show help" correctly display the appropriate sheets
2. Verify that each sheet can be dismissed both manually and with voice commands
3. Test accessibility features in each sheet, particularly VoiceOver compatibility
4. Verify that the sheets display correctly on different device sizes
5. Test that the sheets don't interfere with other voice commands when open
6. Verify proper state management when rapidly switching between sheets
7. Test performance to ensure sheet presentation is smooth and responsive
8. Conduct user testing to verify the sheets are intuitive and useful
