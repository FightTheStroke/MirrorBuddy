File Merging System:\n- mergeRecordingSegments() using AVComposition to combine backup segments\n- Sorts backups by filename, adds in chronological order\n- Uses AVAssetExportSession with M4A preset\n- Cleans up original segments after successful merge\n- Returns single merged file URL\n\n2. Backup Segment Tracking:\n- backupSegments array tracks all auto-saved files\n- Updated on each auto-save (every 30 minutes)\n- Passed to merge function on stop recording\n- All segments cleaned up after merge completes\n\n3. Memory Management:\n- setupMemoryMonitoring() observes UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification\n- handleMemoryWarning() triggers immediate auto-save to free memory\n- Prevents crashes during long 6-hour sessions\n- Weak self captures prevent retain cycles\n\n4. Recording Statistics:\n- RecordingStats struct with duration, fileSize, segmentCount, quality, sessionID\n- Computed properties: fileSizeMB, formattedDuration, formattedFileSize\n- getRecordingStatistics() returns current or final stats\n- Published recordingStats property for UI display\n\n5. Completion Notifications:\n- sendCompletionNotification() sends UNNotification in Italian\n- Smart duration formatting: \"3h 25m\" or \"45 minuti\"\n- Sends immediately after recording stops\n\n6. Abandoned Session Cleanup:\n- cleanupAbandonedSessions() runs on service init\n- Removes backup files older than 7 days from Recordings/Backups\n- Prevents disk space bloat from incomplete recordings\n- Logs cleanup actions\n\n7. Error Recovery:\n- Try/catch around segment merging with fallback to original files\n- Skips invalid backup segments during merge\n- Continues recording on auto-save failures\n- Graceful handling of file system errors\n\nImplementation added approximately 250 lines to ExtendedVoiceRecordingService.swift.

Dynamic carousel approach:\n      - Create a QuickActionProvider service that determines relevant actions based on:\n        * Recent materials the user has accessed\n        * Tasks with upcoming deadlines\n        * Calendar events in the next 24-48 hours\n      - Design a horizontally scrollable carousel UI component\n      - Implement action buttons with appropriate icons and labels\n      - Add animations for smooth transitions when actions change\n      - Ensure actions are contextually relevant to Mario's workflow\n   \n   b. Removal approach:\n      - Assess the current usage and value of the section\n      - Consider user testing to determine if the section is helpful\n      - If removing, ensure proper UI adjustments to maintain visual balance\n      - Update spacing and layout to compensate for the removed section\n\n3.
