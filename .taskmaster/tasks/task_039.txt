# Task ID: 39
# Title: Create Interactive Mind Map Renderer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement an interactive mind map visualization using SwiftUI Canvas.
# Details:
1. Create a SwiftUI Canvas-based renderer
2. Implement force-directed graph layout
3. Add zoom, pan, and pinch gestures
4. Create node expansion/collapse functionality
5. Implement TTS for node explanations
6. Add visual connections with arrows and colors
7. Create animations for interactions
8. Optimize for performance (60 FPS target)

# Test Strategy:
Test renderer with various mind map sizes. Verify gesture handling works correctly. Test node expansion/collapse. Measure rendering performance and frame rate.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement SwiftUI Canvas-Based Mind Map Renderer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the core rendering engine for the mind map using SwiftUI Canvas, supporting dynamic node and connection drawing with custom styling.
### Details:
Create a CanvasView that renders nodes and connections based on a graph model. Implement custom drawing for nodes (text, shapes, colors) and connections (lines, arrows, colors). Ensure the renderer is modular for easy maintenance and extension.

## 2. Add Interactive Gestures and Layout Algorithms [done]
### Dependencies: 39.1
### Description: Enable user interaction through gestures and implement a force-directed graph layout for automatic node positioning.
### Details:
Integrate zoom, pan, and pinch gestures for navigating the mind map. Implement a force-directed layout algorithm to automatically arrange nodes, avoiding overlaps and optimizing readability. Support real-time updates as the graph changes.

## 3. Develop Node Expansion/Collapse and TTS Features [done]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2
### Description: Allow users to expand/collapse nodes and enable text-to-speech (TTS) explanations for selected nodes.
### Details:
Implement tap/gesture handlers to expand or collapse child nodes. Integrate a TTS engine to read aloud node content when selected. Ensure animations are smooth during expansion/collapse and that TTS playback is interruptible and accessible.

## 4. Optimize Performance and Polish Visuals [done]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2, 39.3
### Description: Ensure the mind map renders at 60 FPS and apply visual polish with animations and connection styling.
### Details:
Profile and optimize rendering performance to achieve 60 FPS, especially with large graphs. Add smooth animations for node/connection interactions. Enhance visuals with gradients, shadows, and responsive layouts. Implement connection arrows and color coding for clarity.
