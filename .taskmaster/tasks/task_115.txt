# Task ID: 115
# Title: Enhance Smart Material Query Parsing with Natural Language Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the smart material query parsing system to support natural language patterns, enhance fuzzy matching for material titles, add voice command documentation, and implement user-defined material aliases.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the existing smart material query parsing system with the following improvements:

1. Natural Language Pattern Support:
   - Implement parsing for temporal references like "the last thing I studied" or "my most recent material"
   - Add support for relative references such as "the chapter before this one" or "related to what I studied yesterday"
   - Create a pattern recognition system that maps natural language queries to specific database queries

2. Fuzzy Matching Algorithm Enhancement:
   - Improve the existing fuzzy matching algorithm for material titles
   - Implement Levenshtein distance or similar algorithms with configurable thresholds
   - Add phonetic matching capabilities (e.g., Soundex or Metaphone) for handling pronunciation variations
   - Optimize performance for large material libraries

3. Voice Command Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive examples of voice commands for the help documentation
   - Include common variations and phrasings that users might employ
   - Organize voice commands by category (navigation, search, bookmarking, etc.)
   - Add troubleshooting tips for voice recognition issues

4. Material Aliases Implementation:
   - Design and implement a system allowing users to define custom aliases for materials
   - Create database schema for storing user-defined aliases
   - Develop UI components for managing aliases (create, edit, delete)
   - Ensure aliases are properly indexed for quick retrieval
   - Implement alias resolution in the query parsing pipeline

Technical considerations:
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing query formats
- Maintain performance benchmarks for query parsing speed
- Consider internationalization aspects for non-English queries
- Implement proper error handling for ambiguous queries
- Add telemetry to track which new features are most used

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each new natural language pattern with various inputs
   - Test fuzzy matching algorithm with similar but not identical material titles
   - Verify correct alias resolution with mock database entries
   - Test edge cases like very short aliases or aliases similar to existing commands

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify that the enhanced query parser integrates correctly with the existing search system
   - Test that aliases work properly across different user sessions
   - Ensure voice command examples are correctly displayed in the help documentation
   - Validate that fuzzy matching doesn't impact system performance

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a test script with scenarios covering all new features
   - Recruit a diverse group of users to test natural language queries
   - Collect feedback on the intuitiveness of the alias system
   - Measure success rates for voice commands using the new documentation

4. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark query parsing speed before and after changes
   - Test system performance with a large number of user-defined aliases
   - Measure memory usage during complex natural language query resolution
   - Verify that fuzzy matching remains performant with large material libraries

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure all existing query formats still work correctly
   - Verify that search results remain consistent for identical queries
   - Check that the UI properly displays all new features
