# Task ID: 115
# Title: Enhance Smart Material Query Parsing with Natural Language Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the smart material query parsing system to support natural language patterns, enhance fuzzy matching for material titles, add voice command documentation, and implement user-defined material aliases.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the existing smart material query parsing system with the following improvements:

1. Natural Language Pattern Support:
   - Implement parsing for temporal references like "the last thing I studied" or "my most recent material"
   - Add support for relative references such as "the chapter before this one" or "related to what I studied yesterday"
   - Create a pattern recognition system that maps natural language queries to specific database queries

2. Fuzzy Matching Algorithm Enhancement:
   - Improve the existing fuzzy matching algorithm for material titles
   - Implement Levenshtein distance or similar algorithms with configurable thresholds
   - Add phonetic matching capabilities (e.g., Soundex or Metaphone) for handling pronunciation variations
   - Optimize performance for large material libraries

3. Voice Command Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive examples of voice commands for the help documentation
   - Include common variations and phrasings that users might employ
   - Organize voice commands by category (navigation, search, bookmarking, etc.)
   - Add troubleshooting tips for voice recognition issues

4. Material Aliases Implementation:
   - Design and implement a system allowing users to define custom aliases for materials
   - Create database schema for storing user-defined aliases
   - Develop UI components for managing aliases (create, edit, delete)
   - Ensure aliases are properly indexed for quick retrieval
   - Implement alias resolution in the query parsing pipeline

Technical considerations:
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing query formats
- Maintain performance benchmarks for query parsing speed
- Consider internationalization aspects for non-English queries
- Implement proper error handling for ambiguous queries
- Add telemetry to track which new features are most used

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each new natural language pattern with various inputs
   - Test fuzzy matching algorithm with similar but not identical material titles
   - Verify correct alias resolution with mock database entries
   - Test edge cases like very short aliases or aliases similar to existing commands

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify that the enhanced query parser integrates correctly with the existing search system
   - Test that aliases work properly across different user sessions
   - Ensure voice command examples are correctly displayed in the help documentation
   - Validate that fuzzy matching doesn't impact system performance

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a test script with scenarios covering all new features
   - Recruit a diverse group of users to test natural language queries
   - Collect feedback on the intuitiveness of the alias system
   - Measure success rates for voice commands using the new documentation

4. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark query parsing speed before and after changes
   - Test system performance with a large number of user-defined aliases
   - Measure memory usage during complex natural language query resolution
   - Verify that fuzzy matching remains performant with large material libraries

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure all existing query formats still work correctly
   - Verify that search results remain consistent for identical queries
   - Check that the UI properly displays all new features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Natural Language Pattern Recognition for Temporal and Relative References [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system to parse and interpret natural language queries involving temporal and relative references, such as 'the last thing I studied' or 'the chapter before this one'.
### Details:
Design and implement a pattern recognition module that can identify and map temporal (e.g., 'yesterday', 'last week') and relative (e.g., 'before this', 'after that') references in user queries to specific database queries. Leverage NLP techniques for temporal relation extraction and ensure support for both English and other target languages. Integrate with the existing query parsing pipeline.

## 2. Enhance Fuzzy Matching Algorithm for Material Titles [pending]
### Dependencies: 115.1
### Description: Upgrade the fuzzy matching logic to improve accuracy and performance, including support for phonetic matching and configurable thresholds.
### Details:
Refactor the fuzzy matching component to use advanced algorithms such as Levenshtein distance with adjustable thresholds. Add phonetic matching (e.g., Soundex, Metaphone) to handle pronunciation variations. Optimize for large datasets to maintain fast query response times.

## 3. Design and Implement User-Defined Material Aliases System [pending]
### Dependencies: 115.2
### Description: Allow users to create, edit, and delete custom aliases for materials, and ensure these aliases are integrated into the query parsing process.
### Details:
Create a database schema for storing user-defined aliases. Develop UI components for alias management (create, edit, delete). Ensure aliases are indexed for fast lookup and implement alias resolution in the query parsing pipeline. Maintain compatibility with existing material references.

## 4. Document Voice Command Support and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 115.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for voice command usage, including categorized examples, common variations, and troubleshooting tips.
### Details:
Draft and organize help documentation with examples of supported voice commands, grouped by category (navigation, search, bookmarking, etc.). Include common phrasings and troubleshooting advice for voice recognition issues. Ensure documentation is accessible within the app.

## 5. Integrate Telemetry and Error Handling for New Query Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 115.4
### Description: Add telemetry to monitor usage of new features and implement robust error handling for ambiguous or unsupported queries.
### Details:
Instrument the query parsing system to log usage statistics for natural language patterns, fuzzy matching, and alias resolution. Implement error handling for ambiguous queries, providing user feedback and fallback options. Ensure telemetry respects privacy requirements.
