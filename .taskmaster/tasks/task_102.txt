# Task ID: 102
# Title: Implement Voice-First UI Across the App
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 34, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the application with a comprehensive voice-first UI approach, including context banners, optimized voice activation buttons, and voice indicators to improve accessibility and user experience.
# Details:
1. Dashboard Context Banner:
   - Create a ContextBannerView component to display on DashboardView
   - Show active subject/material information for quick voice access
   - Implement auto-updating based on current context
   - Design with consistent styling matching app theme

2. Voice Activation Button:
   - Position a persistent 80x80pt voice activation button in the bottom-right corner
   - Optimize for one-handed thumb use with proper touch target size
   - Implement haptic feedback on press
   - Add subtle animation for active/inactive states
   - Ensure proper contrast and accessibility

3. Voice Conversation Integration:
   - Wire "Lezione vocale" quick action from DashboardView to launch VoiceConversationView
   - Implement proper navigation and state preservation
   - Add transition animations for smooth user experience

4. Voice Settings Panel:
   - Add settings panel to VoiceConversationView with gear icon
   - Implement microphone preferences (device selection, sensitivity)
   - Add voice speed adjustment (0.8x to 1.5x)
   - Include voice gender/accent options if available
   - Create persistent user preferences storage

5. Voice Indicator Implementation:
   - Create VoiceIndicatorView component for navigation bar
   - Design visual indicators for listening/speaking/processing states
   - Implement consistent appearance across all app screens
   - Ensure proper accessibility labeling

6. Voice Shortcuts:
   - Add voice command shortcuts throughout the app UI
   - Implement for common actions (create, edit, delete, navigate)
   - Create consistent voice command patterns
   - Document all voice commands for user reference

7. Voice Command Labels:
   - Audit all interactive elements to ensure voice command labels
   - Update accessibility identifiers to include voice command hints
   - Implement VoiceOver integration with voice commands
   - Test with screen readers to verify accessibility

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify ContextBannerView displays correct subject/material information
   - Test voice activation button positioning and responsiveness
   - Confirm "Lezione vocale" quick action properly launches VoiceConversationView
   - Validate all settings in the voice settings panel function correctly
   - Test VoiceIndicatorView state changes during voice interactions
   - Verify all voice shortcuts trigger appropriate actions
   - Confirm all interactive elements have proper voice command labels

2. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct one-handed usage tests with various device sizes
   - Measure time to complete common tasks using voice vs. touch
   - Gather feedback on voice button placement and size
   - Test with users of different hand sizes and dexterity levels

3. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify VoiceOver compatibility with all new voice UI elements
   - Test with screen readers to ensure proper labeling
   - Validate color contrast meets accessibility standards
   - Test with users who have motor impairments

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure impact on battery life with voice features active
   - Test voice response latency across different network conditions
   - Verify smooth animations and transitions during voice interactions

5. Integration Testing:
   - Test voice features across all app screens and workflows
   - Verify consistent behavior between voice and touch interactions
   - Validate proper state preservation during navigation
