# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create OpenAI API Client Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a client for OpenAI APIs including Realtime, Chat, and DALL-E endpoints.
# Details:
Create an OpenAIClient class with:
1. Configuration for API keys and endpoints
2. Methods for GPT-5 chat completion
3. Methods for GPT-5 mini vision analysis
4. Methods for GPT-5 nano simple Q&A
5. Methods for DALL-E 3 image generation
6. WebSocket handling for Realtime API
7. Error handling and retry logic
8. Rate limiting implementation
9. Response parsing and model mapping

Implement using Swift concurrency (async/await) and proper error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with mock responses for each API endpoint. Test error handling, retry logic, and rate limiting. Create integration tests with actual API calls using test credentials.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API Key and Endpoint Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up configuration management for API keys and endpoint URLs in the OpenAIClient class.
### Details:
Create properties for storing API keys and endpoint URLs. Ensure secure storage and retrieval, and allow for easy configuration changes. Use Swift's property wrappers or configuration files as needed.

## 2. Develop GPT-5 Chat Completion Method [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement a method for sending chat completion requests to the GPT-5 endpoint.
### Details:
Create an async method that constructs and sends a POST request to the chat completion endpoint. Handle request body formatting, authentication headers, and response parsing using Swift concurrency.

## 3. Develop GPT-5 Mini Vision Analysis Method [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement a method for sending vision analysis requests to the GPT-5 mini endpoint.
### Details:
Create an async method for vision analysis, handling image data encoding, request construction, and response parsing. Ensure compatibility with the endpoint's requirements.

## 4. Develop GPT-5 Nano Simple Q&A Method [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement a method for simple Q&A interactions using the GPT-5 nano endpoint.
### Details:
Create an async method for sending Q&A requests, formatting the input, and parsing the output. Ensure lightweight and efficient handling for simple queries.

## 5. Implement DALL-E 3 Image Generation Method [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add a method for generating images using the DALL-E 3 endpoint.
### Details:
Create an async method that sends text prompts to the DALL-E 3 endpoint, handles authentication, and parses image URLs or binary data from the response.

## 6. Implement WebSocket Handling for Realtime API [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add support for WebSocket connections to handle real-time API interactions.
### Details:
Use Swift concurrency to manage WebSocket connections, message sending, and receiving. Implement connection lifecycle management and reconnection logic.

## 7. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6
### Description: Add robust error handling and retry mechanisms for all API interactions.
### Details:
Define custom error types, handle HTTP and network errors, and implement exponential backoff for retries. Ensure errors are surfaced to the caller appropriately.

## 8. Implement Rate Limiting [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6
### Description: Add rate limiting to prevent exceeding OpenAI API quotas.
### Details:
Track request counts and timing, and throttle requests as needed. Use Swift concurrency primitives to manage rate limits across async calls.

## 9. Implement Response Parsing and Model Mapping [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6
### Description: Parse API responses and map them to Swift models for all endpoints.
### Details:
Define Codable models for each endpoint's response. Implement parsing logic and ensure type safety. Handle edge cases and unexpected response formats.
