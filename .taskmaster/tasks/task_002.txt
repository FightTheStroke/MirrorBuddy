# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate SwiftLint for Code Quality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate SwiftLint into the project to enforce code quality standards with zero warnings requirement.
# Details:
1. Add SwiftLint to the project using Swift Package Manager
2. Create a .swiftlint.yml configuration file in the project root
3. Configure rules to enforce strict code quality standards
4. Add a build phase script to run SwiftLint during compilation
5. Configure CI to fail if any SwiftLint warnings are detected
6. Document SwiftLint setup in README.md
7. Create a pre-commit hook to run SwiftLint before commits

# Test Strategy:
Verify SwiftLint runs during build process. Introduce a test violation and confirm build fails. Ensure all current code passes with zero warnings.
