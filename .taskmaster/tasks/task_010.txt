# Priority: high
# Description: Implement automatic CloudKit synchronization for SwiftData models across user devices.
# Details:
1. Configure SwiftData with CloudKit sync using the `.cloudKit()` modifier
2. Set up proper CloudKit container identifiers
3. Implement conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins for single user)
4. Add sync status indicators in the UI
5. Implement error handling for sync failures
6. Add retry mechanism for failed syncs
7. Create a manual sync trigger for user-initiated syncs
8. Implement background sync using BGProcessingTask

# Test Strategy:
Test sync between multiple devices. Verify data changes propagate correctly. Test conflict resolution with simultaneous edits. Verify offline changes sync when coming back online.
