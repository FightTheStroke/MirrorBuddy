# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Google Calendar Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7 (Not found), 13 (Not found), 16 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with Google Calendar to extract assignment due dates.
# Details:
1. Implement Google Calendar API integration
2. Create functionality to sync calendar events
3. Add assignment due date extraction
4. Create Task objects from calendar events
5. Implement update logic when calendar changes
6. Add notification scheduling before due dates
7. Create background sync using BGAppRefreshTask
8. Implement error handling and retry logic

# Test Strategy:
Test calendar sync with various event types. Verify due date extraction accuracy. Test update handling when calendar changes. Measure sync performance and reliability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Google Calendar API Access and Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Google Cloud project, enable the Calendar API, and set up OAuth 2.0 or JWT authentication for secure access to user calendars.
### Details:
Create a Google Cloud project, enable the Google Calendar API, and configure the OAuth consent screen. Generate API credentials (OAuth client ID or service account key) and integrate authentication logic into the app, ensuring proper scopes for calendar read/write access[1][2]. Handle initial token retrieval and refresh logic.

## 2. Implement Calendar Event Synchronization Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 42.1
### Description: Develop functionality to fetch, parse, and store calendar events from Google Calendar, focusing on assignment due dates.
### Details:
Write code to call the Google Calendar API (events.list) to retrieve events from the user’s primary calendar. Filter and parse events to identify assignment due dates based on event metadata (e.g., title, description). Store synchronized events locally for further processing[3][4]. Implement incremental sync to fetch only new or modified events after the initial sync.

## 3. Create and Manage Task Objects from Calendar Events [done]
### Dependencies: 42.2
### Description: Transform synchronized calendar events into app-specific Task objects and manage their lifecycle.
### Details:
For each relevant calendar event, create a corresponding Task object in the app’s data model, preserving due date, title, and other metadata. Implement logic to update or remove Task objects when the underlying calendar event changes or is deleted. Ensure Task objects remain in sync with the calendar source.

## 4. Implement Background Sync and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 42.3
### Description: Add background synchronization using BGAppRefreshTask and robust error handling with retry logic.
### Details:
Integrate BGAppRefreshTask to periodically sync calendar events in the background, even when the app is not active. Implement comprehensive error handling for network issues, API limits, and authentication failures. Add automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sync attempts. Log errors for debugging and user notification.
