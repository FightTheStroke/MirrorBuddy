# Task ID: 6
# Title: Define SwiftData Models for Flashcards
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create SwiftData models for Flashcard entity with SRS data.
# Details:
Create a Flashcard model with the following properties:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- front: String
- back: String
- material: Relationship to Material entity
- lastReviewed: Date (optional)
- nextReviewDate: Date (optional)
- easeFactor: Double (default: 2.5)
- interval: Int (days, default: 1)
- repetitions: Int (default: 0)

Implement SRS (Spaced Repetition System) algorithm methods:
- calculateNextReview(quality: Int) -> Date
- updateSRSData(quality: Int)

Implement proper relationships with cascade delete rules.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for Flashcard model. Test SRS algorithm functionality with different quality inputs. Verify next review dates are calculated correctly.
