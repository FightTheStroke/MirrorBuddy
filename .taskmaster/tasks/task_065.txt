# Task ID: 65
# Title: Implement Performance Tests
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 59 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create performance tests to verify app meets performance targets.
# Details:
1. Implement app launch time tests
2. Create voice latency tests
3. Add mind map rendering performance tests
4. Implement animation smoothness tests
5. Create memory usage tests
6. Add battery impact tests
7. Implement network efficiency tests
8. Create documentation for performance test results

# Test Strategy:
Use XCTest with performance metrics. Measure time intervals for key operations. Monitor memory usage during tests. Compare results against performance targets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Performance Metrics and Test Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and realistic usage scenarios for the app, covering launch time, voice latency, rendering, animation, memory, battery, and network efficiency.
### Details:
List KPIs such as response time, latency, memory usage, battery consumption, and network throughput. Define test scenarios for each major app function, including app launch, voice input, mind map rendering, animation playback, and typical user flows. Ensure scenarios reflect real-world usage and device/network diversity.

Performance metrics documentation has been created in Docs/PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md. This comprehensive document includes detailed information on all key performance indicators (KPIs), test scenarios, measurement tools, baseline performance targets, and ongoing monitoring strategies. The documentation serves as the central reference for performance testing implementation and can be used to guide the development of automated tests in the next subtask.

## 2. Implement Automated Performance Tests for Core App Features [done]
### Dependencies: 65.1
### Description: Develop and automate performance tests for app launch time, voice latency, mind map rendering, animation smoothness, memory usage, battery impact, and network efficiency.
### Details:
Use XCTest and appropriate profiling tools to automate measurement of each KPI. For each feature, create scripts to measure time intervals, resource usage, and responsiveness under various conditions. Ensure tests run on a range of devices and network profiles. Integrate tests into CI pipeline for repeatability.

## 3. Document and Report Performance Test Results [done]
### Dependencies: 65.2
### Description: Compile, analyze, and document the results of all performance tests, highlighting metrics, findings, and recommendations.
### Details:
Aggregate test outputs into structured reports. Include charts and tables for each KPI across devices and scenarios. Summarize key findings, bottlenecks, and areas for optimization. Provide actionable recommendations and share documentation with stakeholders.
