# Task ID: 101
# Title: Implement Context Integration and Fallback for Voice Coach
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 31, 34, 3, 4, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate StudyCoachPersonality AI service for context-aware responses tailored to learning disabilities and implement fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios.
# Details:
1. Integrate StudyCoachPersonality AI service:
   - Create a service adapter for StudyCoachPersonality API
   - Implement personality profiles tailored to dyslexia/dyscalculia support
   - Add context-aware response generation with empathetic tone

2. Implement Apple Speech Recognition fallback:
   - Create a fallback detection system that monitors OpenAI API availability
   - Implement local Speech Recognition using Apple's frameworks
   - Design a graceful transition between online and offline modes
   - Create simplified response templates for offline mode

3. Wire up real subject/material context:
   - Replace hardcoded "Matematica" strings with dynamic context from SwiftData
   - Create a ContextProvider class to fetch current subject and material details
   - Implement context switching based on user navigation
   - Add subject-specific vocabulary and terminology support

4. Propagate student learning profile:
   - Create a UserPreferenceManager to access learning profiles
   - Implement preference propagation to AI services
   - Add dyslexia/dyscalculia accommodation flags
   - Create adaptive UI based on learning profile

5. Add adaptive difficulty adjustment:
   - Implement ConversationHistoryAnalyzer to track user performance
   - Create difficulty adjustment algorithm based on success/failure patterns
   - Add metadata to conversation turns for performance tracking
   - Implement gradual difficulty progression

6. Implement error recovery:
   - Create an ErrorRecoveryManager for handling API failures
   - Implement graceful degradation of features based on available services
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions
   - Create logging system for error analysis

7. Performance considerations:
   - Implement caching for frequently used context data
   - Optimize network requests to minimize latency
   - Add background prefetching for likely context switches
   - Implement battery usage optimizations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for StudyCoachPersonality service adapter
   - Test fallback detection and transition logic
   - Verify context switching functionality
   - Test difficulty adjustment algorithms with simulated conversation history

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test end-to-end voice conversation with context integration
   - Verify proper context propagation from SwiftData models
   - Test offline mode by simulating API unavailability
   - Verify learning profile preferences affect conversation style

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response time with and without context integration
   - Test battery impact during extended conversations
   - Measure memory usage during context switching
   - Verify network efficiency with large conversation history

4. User Scenario Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for different learning disabilities
   - Test with various subject materials and difficulty levels
   - Verify error recovery in different failure scenarios
   - Test with simulated poor network conditions

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify voice coach accommodates dyslexia/dyscalculia needs
   - Test with screen readers and other accessibility tools
   - Verify error messages are clear and actionable
   - Test color contrast and visual elements for accessibility
