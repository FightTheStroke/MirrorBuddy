# Task ID: 87
# Title: Implement Mind Map Generation from Image and Document Content
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 86
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automatically generate mind maps from extracted text and image content using GPT-4.
# Details:
Send extracted text to GPT-4 API for topic extraction and mind map structuring. Store and display mind maps linked to materials. Support color-coding by subject.

# Test Strategy:
Import documents/images, run OCR, generate mind map. Validate logical structure and subject coloring.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate OCR and Text Extraction for Images and Documents [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and integrate OCR functionality to extract text from uploaded images and documents as the first step in mind map generation.
### Details:
Implement or connect to an OCR library/service (e.g., Vision, Tesseract) to process images and PDF documents, extracting all readable text and metadata for downstream processing.

## 2. Preprocess and Clean Extracted Text for GPT-4 Input [done]
### Dependencies: 87.1
### Description: Prepare and clean the extracted text to ensure optimal input quality for GPT-4 topic extraction and mind map structuring.
### Details:
Remove irrelevant content, normalize whitespace, and segment text into logical sections. Optionally, summarize or chunk large documents to fit GPT-4 input limits.

## 3. Design and Implement GPT-4 Prompting for Mind Map Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 87.2
### Description: Create and refine prompts for GPT-4 to extract topics and generate structured mind map data from preprocessed text.
### Details:
Develop prompt templates that instruct GPT-4 to identify main topics, subtopics, and relationships, and return results in a structured format (e.g., JSON or Markdown suitable for mind map rendering)[1][2][3].

## 4. Implement Mind Map Data Storage and Linking to Materials [done]
### Dependencies: 87.3
### Description: Store generated mind map structures and associate them with their source materials for retrieval and display.
### Details:
Extend the data model to save mind map structures (e.g., as JSON blobs) and link them to the original document/image records. Ensure efficient retrieval and update mechanisms.

After reviewing the existing implementation, the data storage and linking functionality for mind maps is already complete. The MindMapGenerationService includes:

1. A storeMindMap() method for saving mind maps to SwiftData
2. A getMindMap(for materialID:) method for retrieval
3. Proper relationship configuration between Material and MindMap entities
4. Automatic linking via material.mindMap = mindMap assignment
5. Cascade delete rules for proper cleanup

This implementation was completed as part of Task 21.3. The current subtask should focus on verification and documentation of the existing functionality rather than reimplementing these features.

Testing should verify:
- Mind map storage and retrieval works correctly
- Relationship linking between materials and mind maps functions as expected
- Cascade deletion properly removes associated mind maps when materials are deleted
- CloudKit synchronization correctly handles mind map data across devices

Documentation should be updated to reflect the current implementation details for future reference.

## 5. Develop Mind Map Visualization and Color-Coding by Subject [done]
### Dependencies: 87.4
### Description: Create a UI component to render mind maps interactively, supporting color-coding nodes by subject or topic.
### Details:
Use a visualization library (e.g., D3.js, SwiftUI, or a mind map-specific library) to display mind maps. Implement color-coding logic based on subject metadata or GPT-4 output.
<info added on 2025-10-17T05:43:17.544Z>
Verification complete. The InteractiveMindMapView component successfully implements all required visualization features including:
- Canvas-based rendering of mind map nodes and connections
- Color-coding based on node.color property
- Subject-based color assignment from Task 87.3
- Interactive gestures for navigation and manipulation
- All visualization requirements have been met without need for additional libraries

No further development is needed for the visualization component as it meets all specifications.

## 6. End-to-End Testing and Validation of Mind Map Generation Workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 87.5
### Description: Test the complete workflow from image/document upload to mind map display, ensuring logical structure and subject coloring.
### Details:
Perform comprehensive tests covering all steps: extraction, preprocessing, GPT-4 generation, storage, and visualization. Validate logical consistency and user experience.
