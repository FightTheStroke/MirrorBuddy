# Task ID: 37
# Title: Create Combined Vision and Voice Interaction
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 32 (Not found), 33 (Not found), 35 (Not found), 36 (Not found)
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the combined vision and voice interaction for homework help.
# Details:
1. Create a workflow for taking photos and discussing with AI
2. Implement "What's this?" voice command
3. Add continuous conversation about captured images
4. Create functionality to save analyzed problems
5. Implement context switching between images
6. Add history of analyzed problems
7. Create UI for reviewing past analyses
8. Implement sharing of solutions

# Test Strategy:
Test complete workflow from photo capture to AI discussion. Verify voice commands work correctly. Test context switching between images. Evaluate solution quality for various problems.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Vision-Voice Capture Workflow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a seamless workflow for users to capture images of homework problems using the device camera, initiate voice interactions, and discuss the content with the AI assistant.
### Details:
Develop a UI flow that guides users through capturing images, confirms successful capture, and transitions to voice interaction. Integrate camera access, image processing, and voice input handling. Ensure the system can trigger AI analysis upon image capture and voice command.

## 2. Implement Core Voice Commands and Continuous Dialogue [done]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Add support for key voice commands (e.g., 'What's this?') and enable continuous, context-aware conversation about the currently analyzed image.
### Details:
Integrate speech recognition to detect and process specific commands. Implement a dialogue manager to maintain context during multi-turn conversations about the captured image. Ensure the AI can reference the current image and previous interactions accurately.

## 3. Build Image Context Management and History Features [done]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2
### Description: Enable users to switch between analyzed images, save problem analyses, and review a history of past interactions.
### Details:
Develop functionality to save analyzed problems with metadata (e.g., timestamp, subject). Implement context switching to allow users to return to previous images and continue the conversation. Create a UI for browsing and reviewing past analyses, including search and filter options.

## 4. Implement Solution Sharing and Multi-modal Output [done]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2, 37.3
### Description: Allow users to share analyzed solutions and receive AI responses in both visual and auditory formats.
### Details:
Add sharing options for solutions (e.g., export as image, text, or link). Support multi-modal output where the AI can explain solutions using both voice and on-screen visuals. Ensure shared content is accurate and includes relevant context from the conversation.
