# Task ID: 78
# Title: Implement Study Time Tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 46
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensive study time tracking functionality has been implemented, enabling users to track study sessions for XP rewards and analytics. The system supports session tracking, pause detection, XP calculation, subject-specific tracking, analytics, and dashboard integration.
# Details:
Implementation includes:
1. StudySession SwiftData model for session tracking, pause detection, and XP calculation
2. StudyTimerService singleton for session lifecycle management and UserProgress integration
3. StudyTimerView UI with subject selection, controls, and real-time statistics
4. StudyStatisticsView for daily/weekly stats, recent sessions, and streaks
5. StudyInsightsView with charts, subject breakdown, and session history
6. Dashboard integration with live timer card and voice command support
7. SwiftData persistence and CloudKit sync for cross-device data
All core features—session tracking, pause detection, XP rewards, subject tracking, analytics, charts, and dashboard integration—are complete.

# Test Strategy:
Verify end-to-end study session tracking, including pause/resume, XP calculation, and subject selection. Test UI controls for session management. Validate statistics and streaks in StudyStatisticsView. Confirm analytics and charts in StudyInsightsView. Ensure dashboard timer card updates in real time and responds to voice commands. Test SwiftData persistence and CloudKit sync across devices.
