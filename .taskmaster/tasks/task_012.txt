# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Google Gemini API Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a client for Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API for Google Workspace integration.
# Details:
Create a GeminiClient class with:
1. Configuration for API keys and endpoints
2. Methods for text generation and analysis
3. Methods for Drive folder research
4. Methods for Calendar event parsing
5. Methods for Gmail assignment extraction
6. Error handling and retry logic
7. Rate limiting implementation
8. Response parsing and model mapping

Implement using Swift concurrency (async/await) and proper error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with mock responses for each API endpoint. Test error handling, retry logic, and rate limiting. Create integration tests with actual API calls using test credentials.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement GeminiClient Configuration for API Keys and Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up configuration management for API keys and endpoints in GeminiClient, supporting secure storage and environment variable usage.
### Details:
Design GeminiClient to accept API keys via environment variables (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY) or explicit configuration. Ensure endpoints are configurable for different Gemini models and support secure key handling.

## 2. Develop Text Generation and Analysis Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create async methods for text generation and analysis using Gemini 2.5 Pro API endpoints.
### Details:
Implement methods like generateText(prompt:) and analyzeText(input:) using Swift concurrency. Ensure requests are properly formed and responses are parsed for text output.

## 3. Implement Drive Folder Research Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Add methods to GeminiClient for researching and summarizing Google Drive folder contents via Gemini API.
### Details:
Design methods to accept Drive folder identifiers, call Gemini API for summarization or research, and parse structured results. Handle permissions and large folder cases.

## 4. Add Calendar Event Parsing Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement methods to parse and analyze Google Calendar events using Gemini API.
### Details:
Create async methods to send event data to Gemini API, extract insights, and map responses to event models. Support batch processing of multiple events.

## 5. Create Gmail Assignment Extraction Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop methods for extracting assignments or tasks from Gmail messages using Gemini API.
### Details:
Implement methods to process Gmail message content, call Gemini API for assignment extraction, and map results to structured task models.

## 6. Implement Robust Error Handling and Retry Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic to all GeminiClient methods.
### Details:
Define error types for network, API, and parsing failures. Implement exponential backoff for transient errors and ensure all async methods propagate errors correctly.

## 7. Integrate Rate Limiting Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Implement rate limiting in GeminiClient to comply with Gemini API quotas and prevent throttling.
### Details:
Track request counts and timing, enforce per-minute/hour limits, and queue or reject excess requests. Make rate limits configurable.

## 8. Develop Response Parsing and Model Mapping Utilities [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Create utilities for parsing Gemini API responses and mapping them to internal models.
### Details:
Implement parsers for all expected Gemini API response formats. Map parsed data to Swift models for text, Drive, Calendar, and Gmail outputs.
