# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement XP and Leveling System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the experience points and leveling system for gamification.
# Details:
1. Implement XP accumulation logic
2. Create level progression system (1-100)
3. Define XP rewards for various activities
4. Implement XP for completed tasks
5. Add XP for study time tracking
6. Create XP for flashcard reviews
7. Implement daily streak bonuses
8. Create visual progress bar
9. Add level-up animations and celebrations

# Test Strategy:
Test XP accumulation from various sources. Verify level progression works correctly. Test daily streak calculation. Measure performance of animations and celebrations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement XP Accumulation and Reward System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core logic for XP accumulation and define rewards for various user activities within the app.
### Details:
Create a centralized XP service that tracks and awards points for different user actions. Implement the base XP accumulation logic with appropriate data models. Define specific XP rewards for various activities including task completion, study time tracking, flashcard reviews, and daily streaks. Ensure the system is extensible for future gamification features.

## 2. Create Level Progression System [done]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Implement the level progression system with a scale from 1-100 and the required XP thresholds for each level.
### Details:
Design and implement the level progression algorithm with increasing XP requirements for higher levels. Create a mathematical formula for XP thresholds that provides a satisfying progression curve. Implement level-up detection logic that triggers when a user accumulates enough XP to advance. Store current level and progress data in the user profile. Ensure the system handles edge cases like maximum level cap.

## 3. Develop XP Visualization and Celebrations [done]
### Dependencies: 46.2
### Description: Create the visual elements for displaying XP progress and implement level-up animations and celebrations.
### Details:
Design and implement a visual progress bar showing current XP and progress toward the next level. Create engaging level-up animations and celebration sequences that trigger when a user advances to a new level. Implement subtle visual feedback for small XP gains during normal app usage. Ensure all animations are performant and can be disabled in accessibility settings. Add sound effects for level-up events with appropriate volume controls.
