# MirrorBuddy · The Empathic Learning OS

*An aspirational platform that transforms AI into a neurodiverse-ready co-teacher, study partner, and homework hero.*

---

## Why MirrorBuddy exists

Traditional learning tools were designed for “average” students with full executive function, two free hands, perfect reading fluency, and unlimited patience. That student rarely exists.

MirrorBuddy is a moonshot to build the first **voice-first, multimodal learning operating system** that:

- treats every learner like a whole human, not a checklist of deficits,
- understands context across voice, vision, and documents,
- adapts language, pacing, and encouragement to neurodiverse needs,
- stays with a student through school, homework, and life skills.

Think of it as **a 1:1 support teacher, speech therapist, note taker, and gaming buddy rolled into one persistent AI companion.**

## Who we serve (and why the market cares)

We started with Mario, a bright teenager navigating dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and left hemiplegia. Very quickly, the use cases expanded:

| Persona | Pain Point | Why MirrorBuddy matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Neurodiverse learners (K‑12)** | Reading fatigue, working-memory overload, executive function deficits | Natural-language voice guidance, visual mind maps, one-button syncing eliminate context juggling |
| **Inclusive classrooms & resource teachers** | High caseload, limited prep time, inconsistent accommodations | Auto-generated summaries, task digestion, lesson capture, and dashboards scale support without burning out staff |
| **Homeschool cooperatives** | Parents juggling curricula, assessments, and individualized plans | Unified workspace blends Google Drive assets, voice coaching, and progress overviews |
| **University disability centers** | Access services struggle to keep up with demand | Always-on coach provides note expansion, reading support, and conversational check-ins |
| **Adult upskillers & career changers** | Need patient learning companion beyond school | Voice-first coaching and just-in-time summaries make self-study sustainable |

The global assistive education technology sector is accelerating (various analyst reports project double-digit CAGR toward the end of the decade), driven by mandates for inclusive classrooms, rising diagnoses, and post-pandemic comfort with remote support. MirrorBuddy aims to be the **experience layer** stitching together the fractured tooling in that market.

## Product promise

MirrorBuddy focuses on five pillars:

1. **Voice-first & interrupt friendly** — Speak naturally (“Explain this fraction like Fortnite”), interrupt mid-sentence, pick up the thread minutes later.
2. **Multimodal cognition** — Camera, PDFs, emails, mind maps, and voice recordings collapse into a shared context graph.
3. **Emotionally safe coaching** — Tone calibrated for encouragement, neurodiverse pacing, and shame-free retries.
4. **Autopilot organization** — One button (“Aggiornami”) corrals Drive files, Gmail assignments, Calendar events, plus auto-summaries.
5. **Trust-by-design** — On-device personalization, CloudKit sync, robust transparency around API usage; no data hoarding.

We are building toward **an “OS layer” that constantly knows what the learner is working on, senses overwhelm, and offers the next best action through voice or visuals.**

## Near-term roadmap

1. **Voice Autonomy**
   - Apple Speech offline fallback & seamless network handover
   - Context-aware command parsing (“Show me the math map for today”)
   - Tone modulation based on frustration signals
2. **Mind Map 2.0**
   - Mobile-first zoomable flow
   - Voice navigation through nodes (“Jump to the physics example”)
   - Export bridges into classroom tools (Google Classroom, Notability)
3. **Lesson Memory**
   - 6-hour ambient recording with Whisper chunking
   - Automatic timeline + mind map synthesis
   - “Replay the part where the teacher explained parabolas”
4. **Progress Intelligence**
   - Working-memory aware planner
   - Micro achievements (“Two focused sprints today!”)
   - Parent/teacher digest with encouraging framing

The public roadmap lives in `Docs/ExecutionPlan.md` and is mirrored into `.taskmaster`.

## Market & ecosystem signals

- **Inclusive education mandates** (US IDEA, EU accessibility directives) are pushing schools to adopt tech that works for diverse cognitive profiles. Districts now budget specifically for AI-assisted accommodations.
- **Assistive EdTech spend** is accelerating as neurodiversity diagnoses rise (ADHD, dyslexia, autism spectrum). Tools that couple academic support with emotional scaffolding are in demand for both K‑12 and higher education.
- **Parents and homeschool networks** are increasingly tech-forward, searching for AI copilots that can collaborate with their family’s Google Drive/Calendar stack and reduce planning overhead.
- **Wellness & mental health** cross over: many learners want an empathetic voice that celebrates progress and regulates pace to reduce anxiety.

MirrorBuddy aspires to be the connective tissue in this ecosystem—an extensible client orchestrating best-in-class AI providers, campus systems, and human caregivers.

---

## Use case vignettes (future-facing)

- **Night-before-exam triage**: Mario snaps a photo of a physics worksheet. MirrorBuddy extracts the diagram, explains it with Fortnite analogies, and generates a voice-guided walkthrough he can replay on the bus.
- **Inclusive classroom station**: A resource teacher runs MirrorBuddy on an iPad at the support desk. Students drop off PDFs or voice questions; the system prepares simplified mind maps and suggests conversation starters.
- **Parent review loop**: After homework, MirrorBuddy summarizes what Mario tackled, highlights sticking points with recommended games or videos, and nudges his parent (“Celebrate the geometry win!”).
- **Workplace upskilling**: An adult learner feeds onboarding manuals into MirrorBuddy, which turns them into bite-sized flashcards, mock Q&A sessions, and daily voice check-ins.

## Contribution philosophy

MirrorBuddy is early, ambitious, and opinionated. Contributions we value most:

1. **Neurodiversity-first UI** — richer voice command flows, low-cognitive-load layouts, courageously simple copy.
2. **Explainable AI** — translation layers that help students understand *why* an answer is correct.
3. **Safeguards & trust** — audit trails, parent/teacher controls, privacy guardrails.
4. **Context expansion** — connectors to additional ecosystems (Canvas, Notion, Microsoft 365) while honoring privacy.

Please review `Docs/AGENT_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md` for the tasking model and submit PRs with accessibility considerations documented.

### Quality Assurance and Release Process

Before submitting significant changes or preparing for a release:

1. **Run the QA Checklist**: Execute manual tests from `Docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md` covering:
   - Online/offline resilience
   - Voice command functionality
   - Accessibility compliance (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, touch targets)
   - Performance under stress
   - Data integrity across devices

2. **SwiftLint Compliance**: Ensure `swiftlint lint` shows ≤400 violations (current baseline). Pre-commit hooks enforce this automatically.

3. **Build Verification**: Confirm build succeeds on both iOS Simulator and physical devices (iPhone 14+, iPad 13).

4. **Regression Testing**: Verify all critical regression tests from the QA checklist pass (Section 10).

**Release Criteria**: All "Critical" items in the QA checklist must pass before tagging a release.
