## The Manifesto

**Every child deserves an education that fits them—not the other way around.**

Traditional schools were designed for the "average" student. But there is no average student. There are children with dyslexia who think in pictures. Children with ADHD who need movement and variety. Children with autism who thrive on structure and clarity. Children with cerebral palsy who need adaptive interfaces.

These children are not broken. The system is.

**ConvergioEdu is our answer: a school that adapts to each student, not students who must adapt to school.**

## The Story Behind This

This project was born for **Mario**.

Mario survived a pediatric stroke at birth. It left him with cerebral palsy. Like millions of children with learning differences, Mario faced a school system that wasn't built for him: rigid schedules, inflexible methods, one-size-fits-all teaching.

In 2013, his parents founded [FightTheStroke](https://fightthestroke.org) to fight for children like Mario. After a decade of advocacy, research, and watching AI transform what's possible, they built what they always wanted: **the school Mario deserved**.

> *"A birth accident should not dictate a child's future."*

## Learning WITH the Greats, Not About Them

Here's what makes ConvergioEdu different.

Instead of reading *about* Euclid in a textbook, students learn mathematics **with Euclid himself**. Instead of memorizing dates about Darwin, they explore evolution **alongside Darwin**. Instead of watching a video about Marie Curie, they discuss chemistry **with Curie**.

Each **Maestro** is an AI tutor embodying a legendary figure from history—someone who revolutionized their field. Students don't just learn subjects; they learn *from the masters*.

| Maestro | Subject | Why This Legend? |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Euclide** | Mathematics | Father of geometry, wrote *Elements*—the most influential math textbook ever |
| **Leonardo** | Art | The original Renaissance polymath who merged art and science |
| **Darwin** | Science | Changed our understanding of life itself with evolution |
| **Curie** | Chemistry | First woman to win a Nobel, pioneer of radioactivity |
| **Feynman** | Physics | Made quantum physics understandable, legendary teacher |
| **Galileo** | Astronomy | Father of modern science and the scientific method |
| **Lovelace** | Computer Science | The first programmer, a century before computers existed |
| **Shakespeare** | English | The Bard who shaped the English language |
| **Mozart** | Music | Composed masterpieces from age 5, pure musical genius |
| **Socrate** | Philosophy | Invented the Socratic method—learning through questions |
| **Erodoto** | History | The "Father of History" who pioneered historical inquiry |
| **Manzoni** | Italian | Italy's greatest novelist, master of language |
| **Cicerone** | Civic Education | Rome's greatest orator, defender of the republic |
| **Humboldt** | Geography | Explorer who invented biogeography and ecology |
| **Ippocrate** | Physical Education | Father of medicine, champion of healthy living |
| **Smith** | Economics | Wrote *The Wealth of Nations*, founded modern economics |
| **Chris** | Storytelling | Chris Anderson, TED curator who spread "ideas worth sharing" worldwide |

### What Makes Each Maestro Special

Every Maestro:
- **Speaks naturally** — Real voice conversations, not text-to-speech robots
- **Adapts in real-time** — Slower when you struggle, faster when you're ready
- **Never judges** — No frustration, no impatience, infinite patience
- **Creates for you** — Generates mind maps, flashcards, quizzes on the fly
- **Remembers you** — Knows your progress, your struggles, your victories

## Built for Every Mind

ConvergioEdu isn't just "accessible." It's designed from the ground up for neurodiversity.

| Condition | How We Adapt |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Dyslexia** | OpenDyslexic font, extra spacing, text-to-speech, visual learning |
| **Dyscalculia** | Step-by-step breakdowns, visual number representations |
| **ADHD** | Reduced distractions, focus mode, movement breaks, gamification |
| **Autism** | Predictable layouts, sensory-friendly colors, clear structure |
| **Cerebral Palsy** | Large touch targets, full keyboard navigation, voice control |

WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. Because accessibility isn't a feature—it's the foundation.

## Configuration

### AI Providers

ConvergioEdu supports multiple AI providers. Choose based on your needs:

| Provider | Voice Support | Best For | Cost |
|----------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Azure OpenAI** | Full voice | Production, schools | Pay-per-use |
| **Ollama** | Text only | Local dev, privacy | Free |

### Option 1: Azure OpenAI (Recommended)

Full functionality including voice sessions.

```bash
# .env.local

# Chat (text conversations)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-08-01-preview

# Voice (real-time conversations) — REQUIRED for voice features
AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-realtime-preview
```

**Note:** Voice features require the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` model, currently available in select Azure regions.

### Option 2: Ollama (100% Local)

Free, private, runs entirely on your machine. No voice support.

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# Start the server
ollama serve

# Pull a model (in another terminal)
ollama pull llama3.2        # Fast, good for education (~2GB)
ollama pull mistral         # Alternative (~4GB)
ollama pull llama3.1:70b    # Best quality (needs 64GB+ RAM)
```

```bash
# .env.local
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
```

The app auto-detects Ollama when Azure is not configured.

### Azure Cost Management (Optional)

Track your Azure spending in the Settings page.

```bash
# .env.local (optional)
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-service-principal-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-service-principal-secret
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
```

Requires a Service Principal with "Cost Management Reader" role.
