## Basic Search Commands

### Simple Search

```
"Find materials about algebra"
"Show me biology notes"
"Search for quadratic equations"
```

**Variations:**
- "Find [topic]"
- "Show me [topic]"
- "Search [topic]"
- "Materials about [topic]"

### Subject-Based Search
Filter materials by subject:

```
"Show my math materials"
"Find all physics notes"
"Get my history materials"
```

**Supported Subjects:**
- Mathematics (math, matematica)
- Physics (physics, fisica)
- Biology (biology, biologia)
- Chemistry (chemistry, chimica)
- History (history, storia)
- Geography (geography, geografia)
- English (english, inglese)
- Italian (italian, italiano)

### Most Recent Material
```
"Show the last thing I studied"
"What did I study most recently?"
"Find my latest material"
```

---

## Temporal References

### Absolute Time References

#### Today
```
"Show materials from today"
"Today's materials"
"What I studied today"
```

#### Yesterday
```
"Show materials from yesterday"
"Yesterday's materials"
"What I studied yesterday"
```

#### This Week/Month
```
"Show this week's materials"
"Materials from this month"
"This week's notes"
```

### Relative Time References

#### Days Ago
```
"Show materials from 3 days ago"
"Materials from 5 days ago"
"What I studied 2 days ago"
```

**Pattern:** `[number] days/weeks/months ago`

#### Named Days
```
"Show materials from last Monday"
"Last Tuesday's materials"
"What I studied last Friday"
```

**Supported Days:**
- Monday (lunedì)
- Tuesday (martedì)
- Wednesday (mercoledì)
- Thursday (giovedì)
- Friday (venerdì)
- Saturday (sabato)
- Sunday (domenica)

### Contextual Time References

#### Recent Materials
```
"Show recent materials"      // Last 7 days
"Most recent materials"        // Last 3 days
"Latest materials"             // Last 24 hours
```

#### Review-Based
```
"Show materials I haven't reviewed"
"Unreviewed materials"
"Materials I need to study"
```

---

## Fuzzy Matching

The system automatically handles typos and phonetic variations:

### Spelling Variations
```
"Find quadratic equation"
→ Matches: "quadratic", "quadrtatic", "quadradic", "cuadratic"
```

### Phonetic Matching
```
"Show mnemonic devices"
→ Matches: "mnemonic", "noomonic", "neumonic", "neumonic"
```

```
"Find phosphorus"
→ Matches: "phosphorus", "fosforus", "phosphorous"
```

### Configuration
- **Default Threshold:** Up to 3 character differences allowed
- **Minimum Similarity:** 60% match required
- **Phonetic Matching:** Enabled by default using Soundex algorithm

### How It Works
1. **Levenshtein Distance:** Calculates character edit distance
2. **Soundex Encoding:** Matches phonetically similar words
3. **Partial Matching:** Finds substring matches
4. **Word-Level Matching:** Matches individual words in multi-word queries

---

## Material Aliases

Create custom shortcuts for frequently accessed materials.

### Creating Aliases
1. Navigate to **Settings > Material Aliases**
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Enter alias name (2-50 characters)
4. Select target material
5. Optional: Add notes

### Using Aliases
```
"Open bio"                    // If "bio" alias exists
"Show math notes"             // If "math notes" alias exists
"Find history chapter 3"      // If "history chapter 3" alias exists
```

### Alias Rules
- **Length:** 2-50 characters
- **Allowed Characters:** Letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores
- **Case Insensitive:** "Bio" and "bio" are treated the same
- **Unique:** Each alias must be unique
- **Active/Inactive:** Aliases can be deactivated without deletion

### Best Practices
- Use short, memorable names
- Avoid aliases similar to common commands
- Use subject abbreviations (e.g., "bio" for biology)
- Create aliases for frequently accessed materials

---

## Advanced Filters

### Difficulty-Based Filters

#### Difficult Materials
```
"Show materials I struggled with"
"Difficult materials"
"Challenging topics"
"Hard materials in math"
```

#### Easy Materials
```
"Show easy materials"
"Simple materials"
"Basic materials"
```

### Review Status

#### Unreviewed
```
"Show materials I haven't reviewed"
"Unreviewed materials"
"Materials I haven't studied"
"Materials to review"
```

#### Reviewed
```
"Show reviewed materials"
"Materials I've studied"
"Reviewed materials from this week"
```

### Combined Filters
```
"Show difficult math materials from this week"
"Unreviewed physics materials"
"Easy materials I studied yesterday"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Recognized

**Problem:** Voice command isn't working or gives unexpected results

**Solutions:**
1. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
2. Try rephrasing using simpler language
3. Use subject names exactly as they appear in your materials
4. Check for background noise interference
5. Ensure microphone permissions are enabled

### Wrong Material Found

**Problem:** Search returns incorrect materials

**Solutions:**
1. Be more specific with material titles or subjects
2. Create an alias for frequently used materials
3. Use time-based filters to narrow down results
4. Try using exact quotes for multi-word searches
5. Check material titles in the Materials tab

### Fuzzy Search Too Broad

**Problem:** Getting too many unrelated results

**Solutions:**
1. Use more specific keywords
2. Add subject filters (e.g., "in math")
3. Use time-based filters (e.g., "from this week")
4. Create aliases for precise material access
5. Use exact material titles when possible

### Alias Not Working

**Problem:** Custom alias isn't recognized

**Solutions:**
1. Check alias spelling in **Settings > Material Aliases**
2. Ensure alias is marked as **Active**
3. Try using simpler alias names (2-3 words max)
4. Avoid aliases similar to common commands
5. Rebuild alias cache by toggling alias active status

### Low Confidence Results

**Problem:** System reports low confidence in query results

**Solutions:**
1. Add more context to your query
2. Use temporal references to narrow the search
3. Include subject names in the query
4. Create aliases for ambiguous materials
5. Review query in telemetry for insights

---

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Search Speed
1. **Use Aliases:** Fastest lookup method
2. **Be Specific:** More specific queries return faster
3. **Limit Results:** Use time-based filters
4. **Cache Warmup:** Frequently used aliases are cached

### Best Query Practices
1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic keywords
2. **Add Filters:** Progressively add constraints
3. **Use Temporal Context:** "from yesterday" is faster than "recent"
4. **Leverage Aliases:** Create shortcuts for repeated searches

```

### Subject-Focused Study
```
1. "Show all unreviewed math materials"
2. "Find difficult chemistry topics"
3. "Display this week's biology materials"
4. "Show easy physics materials"
```
