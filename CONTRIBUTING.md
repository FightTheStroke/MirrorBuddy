   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MirrorBuddy.git
   cd MirrorBuddy
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open MirrorBuddy.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys**

   Create a `Config/APIKeys.swift` file:
   ```swift
   enum APIKeys {
       static let openAI = "sk-..."
       static let anthropic = "sk-ant-..."  // Optional
       static let googleClientID = "..."     // Optional
   }
   ```

4. **Configure Signing**
   - Select your Apple Developer team in project settings
   - Update bundle identifier if needed

## Coding Guidelines

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).

Key points:

- **Naming**: Clear, descriptive names over brevity
- **Formatting**: Use Xcode's default formatting (Ctrl+I)
- **Documentation**: Document all public APIs with `///`
- **Access Control**: Use `private` by default, expose what's needed

### SwiftLint

All code must pass SwiftLint in **strict mode** with **zero violations**.

```bash
# Run SwiftLint
swiftlint lint --strict

# Auto-fix what's possible
swiftlint --fix
```

Common rules:
- No force unwraps (`!`)
- No force casts (`as!`)
- Max function length: 50 lines
- Max cyclomatic complexity: 10
- Proper number separators (1_000 not 1000)

### Swift 6.0 Concurrency

- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code
- Use `actor` for thread-safe shared mutable state
- Use `@MainActor` for UI-related code
- Enable strict concurrency checking

### Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write integration tests for API clients
- Write UI tests for critical user flows
- Maintain >80% code coverage for new code

```bash
# Run tests
xcodebuild test -scheme MirrorBuddy -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
```

### Accessibility

This app is designed for students with disabilities. **Every feature must be accessible.**

- ‚úÖ VoiceOver support
- ‚úÖ Dynamic Type support
- ‚úÖ High contrast support
- ‚úÖ Voice control compatibility
- ‚úÖ Reduce motion support

Test with Accessibility Inspector in Xcode.

### Localization

- All user-facing strings must be localized
- Add strings to `Localizable.xcstrings`
- Provide both Italian and English translations
- Test both languages before submitting

```swift
// Good ‚úÖ
Text(String(localized: "hello.message"))

// Bad ‚ùå
Text("Hello, World!")
```

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling

### Examples

```bash
feat(voice): add real-time voice interruption support

Implemented bidirectional audio streaming using OpenAI Realtime API.
Students can now interrupt the AI mid-response for clarifications.

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(sync): resolve CloudKit sync conflict on concurrent edits

Added conflict resolution strategy that preserves local changes
while merging remote updates using CKRecordZone.

Fixes #456
```

### Rules

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Working on a Feature

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/voice-interruption

# Make changes, commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat(voice): add interruption detection"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/voice-interruption

# Open PR on GitHub
```

### Keeping Up to Date

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch
git rebase upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts if any
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/voice-interruption
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Located in `MirrorBuddyTests/`.

```swift
@testable import MirrorBuddy
import XCTest

final class OpenAIClientTests: XCTestCase {
    func testChatCompletion() async throws {
        // Arrange
        let client = OpenAIClient(configuration: testConfig)

        // Act
        let response = try await client.chatCompletion(...)

        // Assert
        XCTAssertNotNil(response.choices.first)
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

Test real API interactions with test accounts.

### UI Tests

Located in `MirrorBuddyUITests/`.

```swift
final class VoiceCoachUITests: XCTestCase {
    func testVoiceRecordingButton() {
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()

        let recordButton = app.buttons["voice.record"]
        XCTAssertTrue(recordButton.exists)

        recordButton.tap()
        XCTAssertTrue(recordButton.label.contains("Recording"))
    }
}
```
