# üî¥ Task Master Quality Assurance (tmQA)

Comprehensive quality assurance system that verifies all completed tasks meet the highest standards.

## üéØ Purpose

Systematically verify that all tasks marked as "done" in Task Master:
- ‚úÖ Are **actually complete** and **working**
- üìö Have **complete documentation**
- üßπ Don't introduce **technical debt**
- üéØ Align with **repository mission and objectives**

## Usage

```
/tmQA
```

This command launches the task-checker agent to perform comprehensive quality assurance on all completed tasks and generates a detailed report.

## üî¥ Brutally Honest Approach

**NO SUGARCOATING. NO EXCUSES. ONLY TRUTH.**

This QA process is **brutally honest** because:

- **If it doesn't work, we say it doesn't work** - No "mostly works" or "should work"
- **Technical debt is called out by name** - No hiding behind "could be improved"
- **Missing documentation = FAIL** - No excuses about "planning to add it later"
- **Fake implementations are exposed** - Tasks marked "done" with no actual code
- **Quality issues are HIGH severity** - Not "minor improvements"

### The tmQA Philosophy

```
‚úÖ PASS = Production ready, no compromises
‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL = Has issues, needs fixes before shipping
üî¥ FAIL = Not acceptable, start over or major rework
```

**No middle ground. No "good enough for now."**

### Report Language

The report uses **direct, unambiguous language**:

‚ùå **NEVER say:**
- "Could be improved"
- "Might have issues"
- "Some edge cases not handled"
- "Should work fine"
- "Mostly complete"

‚úÖ **ALWAYS say:**
- "Code quality: FAIL - Duplicated logic in 5 places"
- "Documentation: INCOMPLETE - No ADR, no comments, no README update"
- "Implementation: BROKEN - Feature crashes on launch"
- "Testing: MISSING - 0 tests written"
- "Technical debt: HIGH - 47 TODO comments, no error handling"

### If You Find Issues, Say It Loudly

```markdown
üö® CRITICAL: Task X marked "done" but feature doesn't work
üö® CRITICAL: No tests, no documentation, hardcoded values everywhere
üö® CRITICAL: Introduced 3 memory leaks and broke 2 existing features
```

**The goal is improvement through honesty, not comfort through lies.**

## üî¥ Quality Assurance Checklist

### 1. üéØ Mission & Objectives Alignment

For each task, verify it aligns with repository goals:

**Read project documentation:**
```bash
cat README.md
cat CLAUDE.md
cat .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Task contributes to project mission
- [ ] Implements requirements from PRD
- [ ] Follows architectural decisions (ADRs)

## üî¥ Workflow

### Step 1: Get All Completed Tasks

```bash
task-master list --status=done
```

Review the list and note all task IDs marked as "done".

### Step 2: Launch Task-Checker Agents (PARALLEL EXECUTION)

**üöÄ MAXIMUM PARALLELISM STRATEGY**

Launch task-checker agents for **ALL** completed tasks **IN PARALLEL** for maximum speed:

**Step 2.1: Intelligent Model Selection**

tmQA uses different Claude models based on task complexity for optimal speed/accuracy balance:

**üöÄ Claude 3.5 Haiku** (Fast, Cost-Effective)
- Repository Cleanliness Inspector
- Simple file scanning tasks
- .gitignore verification
- Git status checks
- **Why**: File operations, pattern matching, no deep reasoning needed
- **Speed**: ~3-5 min

**‚ö° Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Balanced, Default)
- Task-checker agents (most tasks)
- Architecture Analyzer
- Feature catalog building
- Code review
- **Why**: Requires code understanding, pattern detection, quality assessment
- **Speed**: ~5-10 min

**üß† Claude 3 Opus / Extended Thinking** (Deep Reasoning)
- Complex architectural decisions
- Circular dependency analysis
- Deep coupling/cohesion analysis
- **Why**: Requires deep reasoning about system design
- **Speed**: ~8-15 min
- **Note**: Use sparingly, only for complex analysis

**Recommendation**: Let Claude Code auto-select. The Task tool will choose appropriately based on prompt complexity.

**Step 2.2: Prepare Agent List**

```bash
# Get all done task IDs
task-master list --status=done | grep -o "Task [0-9]*" | awk '{print $2}'
```

Example output: `113, 121, 137, 138` (4 tasks)

**Step 2.3: Launch ALL Agents in SINGLE Message**

**CRITICAL**: Use **ONE message** with **MULTIPLE Task tool calls** to launch all agents simultaneously.

Example for 4 tasks:
```
I will launch 4 task-checker agents in parallel to verify tasks 113, 121, 137, and 138 simultaneously.

[Use Task tool - agent 1 for task 113]
[Use Task tool - agent 2 for task 121]
[Use Task tool - agent 3 for task 137]
[Use Task tool - agent 4 for task 138]
```

**Why parallel?**
- 4 tasks serially = ~40 minutes (10 min each)
- 4 tasks parallel = ~10 minutes (all at once)
- **4x FASTER** ‚ö°

**Step 2.4: Special Agents for Global Analysis**

In addition to per-task agents, launch **2 special agents** for repository-wide analysis:

**Agent A: Repository Cleanliness Inspector**
- Single dedicated agent
- Scans entire repo for junk files
- Checks .gitignore completeness
- Verifies documentation freshness
- Runs in parallel with task agents

**Agent B: Architecture Analyzer**
- Single dedicated agent
- Maps complete feature catalog
- Builds dependency graph
- Analyzes coupling/cohesion
- Runs in parallel with task agents

**Total agents = N tasks + 2 global agents**

Example: 4 tasks = 6 agents running simultaneously

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- Cleanliness Inspector ‚Üí Haiku (fast file scanning)
- Architecture Analyzer ‚Üí Sonnet (balanced analysis)
- Task-checkers ‚Üí Sonnet (default for code review)

**Step 2.5: Agent Instructions Template**

**For each task-checker agent**, provide these instructions:

```
üî¥ COMPREHENSIVE QA VERIFICATION - Task ID: <task-id>

Perform exhaustive quality assurance following the tmQA protocol:

## 0. REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION ANALYSIS (üìÅ)
**FIRST TIME ONLY** - If this is the first task being verified, analyze the entire repository:

- Map complete directory structure
- Identify ALL features in the codebase
- Document feature locations (which files implement which features)
- Build feature dependency graph (which features depend on which)
- Identify architecture patterns used
- Analyze module cohesion and coupling
- Find circular dependencies
- Assess feature completeness (implementation, tests, docs)

Use glob patterns to find feature implementations:
```bash
# Find all Swift/TS/Python/etc files
find . -name "*.swift" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py"

# Search for feature keywords
grep -r "class.*Manager" .
grep -r "protocol.*Service" .
grep -r "struct.*View" .
```

Build the complete feature catalog for the report.

## 1. REPOSITORY CLEANLINESS (üßπ)
**EVERY TIME** - Always check repository cleanliness:

### Git Status Check
```bash
git status
```

**Look for:**
- Untracked files that shouldn't exist
- Modified files not committed
- Uncommitted changes

### Junk Files Detection
```bash
# macOS junk
find . -name ".DS_Store"

# Build artifacts
find . -name "*.build" -o -name "DerivedData" -o -name "build/"
find . -name "*.xcodeproj/xcuserdata" -o -name "*.xcworkspace/xcuserdata"

# Temporary files
find . -name "*.tmp" -o -name "*.temp" -o -name "*~" -o -name "*.bak"

# Log files
find . -name "*.log"

# Node/npm artifacts (if applicable)
find . -name "node_modules" -type d

# Python artifacts (if applicable)
find . -name "__pycache__" -o -name "*.pyc"

# Cache files
find . -name ".cache" -o -name "*.cache"

# Backup files
find . -name "*.orig" -o -name "*.swp" -o -name "*.swo"

# Editor configs scattered around
find . -name ".vscode" -o -name ".idea" -type d
```

### .gitignore Verification
```bash
cat .gitignore
```

**Verify .gitignore includes:**
- Build directories
- IDE-specific files
- Temporary files
- Log files
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store)
- Secrets and credentials files

### Documentation Freshness
```bash
# Check when documentation was last updated
ls -lt README.md CHANGELOG.md Docs/*.md

# Compare with recent code changes
git log --since="1 month ago" --oneline | head -20
```

**Verify:**
- README.md updated within last 30 days (if active development)
- CHANGELOG.md has entry for latest changes
- Documentation reflects current codebase state
- No outdated examples or instructions
- All links work (no 404s)

### Orphaned Files
```bash
# Find files not referenced anywhere
# (manual inspection needed)

# Check for old test files
find . -name "*Test.swift" -o -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "test_*.py"

# Check for commented-out files
ls | grep -i "old\|backup\|archive\|deprecated"
```

**Issues to Report:**
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Secrets or credentials files not in .gitignore
- üî¥ **HIGH**: Build artifacts committed to repo
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**: Junk files (.DS_Store, temp files) scattered around
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**: Documentation outdated (>30 days old with recent code changes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW**: Orphaned test files or old backups
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW**: Editor configs not in .gitignore

## 2. MISSION ALIGNMENT (üéØ)
- Read: README.md, CLAUDE.md, .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
- Verify task aligns with project mission and goals
- Check if task is in PRD scope
- Confirm no scope creep
- Check task fits into overall repository organization

## 3. TECHNICAL DEBT SCAN (üßπ)
- Search for TODO, FIXME, HACK in code: grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" .
- Check for code duplication
- Review architecture patterns (SOLID, DDD, Clean Architecture)
- Verify no hardcoded values
- Check for memory leaks in closures
- Review security (no exposed secrets, proper validation)
- Assess performance (no N+1, proper indexing)
- Identify tight coupling between modules
- Find circular dependencies

## 4. DOCUMENTATION AUDIT (üìö)
- Verify all public APIs documented
- Check ADRs exist for architectural decisions
- Confirm CHANGELOG.md updated
- Ensure README.md reflects changes (if applicable)
- Validate all subtasks have implementation notes
- Review inline code comments

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION (‚úÖ)
- Get task details: task-master show <task-id>
- Read ALL files mentioned in task
- Build the project (appropriate build command for tech stack)
- Run ALL tests
- Test feature manually
- Verify all subtasks are genuinely complete
- Check git commits reference task ID

## 6. GENERATE DETAILED REPORT

For THIS task, create a section in TMQAReport.md:

## 6. UPDATE TASK STATUS

If issues found:
```bash
task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=review
task-master update-task --id=<task-id> --prompt="üî¥ QA Issues found: [detailed list]"
```

If passed all checks:
```bash
# Keep as done, add verification note
task-master update-task --id=<task-id> --append --prompt="‚úÖ QA Verified: All checks passed"
```
```

**Step 2.6: Special Agent A - Repository Cleanliness Inspector**

Launch this agent **in parallel** with task agents using:

**Task tool with subagent_type="task-checker"**

Provide these instructions:

```
üßπ REPOSITORY CLEANLINESS INSPECTION

Your mission: Scan the entire repository for cleanliness issues.

## Tasks:

1. **Git Status Audit**
```bash
git status
git status --porcelain
```
Report: Untracked files, uncommitted changes, modified files

2. **Junk Files Scan**
```bash
# macOS artifacts
find . -name ".DS_Store" -print

# Build artifacts
find . -name "DerivedData" -o -name "*.build" -o -name "build/"
find . -name "*.xcodeproj/xcuserdata" -o -name "*.xcworkspace/xcuserdata"

# Temporary files
find . -name "*.tmp" -o -name "*.temp" -o -name "*~" -o -name "*.bak"

# Log files
find . -name "*.log" -print

# Cache files
find . -name ".cache" -o -name "*.cache"

# Editor artifacts
find . -name "*.swp" -o -name "*.swo" -o -name "*.orig"

# Old/backup directories
find . -type d -name "*old*" -o -name "*backup*" -o -name "*archive*"
```

3. **.gitignore Analysis**
```bash
cat .gitignore
```
Check coverage:
- Build artifacts
- IDE files (.vscode, .idea)
- OS files (.DS_Store)
- Temp files
- Secrets/credentials

4. **Documentation Freshness**
```bash
ls -lt README.md CHANGELOG.md CLAUDE.md Docs/*.md | head -20
git log --since="30 days ago" --oneline -- "*.swift" "*.ts" "*.py" | wc -l
```

Compare doc update dates with code activity.

5. **Generate Cleanliness Section for TMQAReport.md**

Include:
- Full git status
- Complete list of junk files with paths
- .gitignore gaps
- Documentation freshness table
- Cleanup actions (CRITICAL/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Cleanliness score (0-100%)

**Output:** Complete "Repository Cleanliness Report" section for the final report.
```

**Step 2.7: Special Agent B - Architecture Analyzer**

Launch this agent **in parallel** with all others using:

**Task tool with subagent_type="Explore"**

Provide these instructions:

```
üìÅ REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

Your mission: Map complete feature catalog and architecture.

## Tasks:

1. **Directory Structure Mapping**
```bash
tree -L 3 -I 'DerivedData|Build|*.xcodeproj|node_modules'
# or
find . -type d -maxdepth 3 | grep -v DerivedData | grep -v Build
```

2. **Feature Discovery**
```bash
# Swift features
grep -r "class.*Manager" --include="*.swift" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
grep -r "protocol.*Service" --include="*.swift" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
grep -r "struct.*View" --include="*.swift" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
grep -r "final class" --include="*.swift" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u

# Find all main Swift files
find . -name "*.swift" -not -path "*/Tests/*" | head -50
```

3. **Build Complete Feature Catalog**

For each feature found, document:
- Feature name
- Implementation status (Implemented/Partial/Planned)
- File locations
- Dependencies (imports, uses)
- Dependents (what uses this)
- Quality status (from task verifications)

4. **Dependency Graph Construction**
```bash
# Analyze imports
grep -r "^import " --include="*.swift" | head -100

# Find feature interconnections
# (analyze class references, protocol conformances)
```

5. **Architecture Pattern Detection**

Identify:
- MVVM patterns
- Repository pattern
- Service layer pattern
- Dependency injection usage
- Singleton usage

6. **Module Coupling Analysis**

Analyze:
- High cohesion modules (good)
- Low coupling modules (good)
- Tight coupling (bad)
- Circular dependencies (very bad)

7. **Generate Architecture Sections for TMQAReport.md**

Include:
- Complete project structure tree
- Full feature catalog with metadata
- Feature dependency graph
- Interconnection matrix
- Architecture patterns used
- Cohesion/coupling analysis
- Feature completeness map

**Output:** Complete "Repository Organization Analysis" section for the final report.
```

**Step 2.8: Example Parallel Launch**

**Concrete example with 4 completed tasks (113, 121, 137, 138):**

Launch **6 agents total** in **ONE message**:

```
I will launch 6 agents in parallel for comprehensive QA:

Agent 1: Task-checker for Task 113
Agent 2: Task-checker for Task 121
Agent 3: Task-checker for Task 137
Agent 4: Task-checker for Task 138
Agent 5: Repository Cleanliness Inspector
Agent 6: Architecture Analyzer

[Use Task tool with subagent_type="task-checker" - Agent 1 instructions for Task 113]
[Use Task tool with subagent_type="task-checker" - Agent 2 instructions for Task 121]
[Use Task tool with subagent_type="task-checker" - Agent 3 instructions for Task 137]
[Use Task tool with subagent_type="task-checker" - Agent 4 instructions for Task 138]
[Use Task tool with subagent_type="task-checker" - Agent 5 Cleanliness instructions]
[Use Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" - Agent 6 Architecture instructions]
```

All 6 agents execute simultaneously.

**Step 2.9: Monitor Agent Progress**

All agents run in parallel. Monitor their completion:

```bash
# Agents will report back when complete
# Task-checker agents: ~5-10 min each
# Cleanliness agent: ~3-5 min
# Architecture agent: ~5-8 min

# Total wall time: ~10 min (vs ~40 min serial)
# Speed improvement: 4x faster ‚ö°
```

**Wait for ALL agents to complete before proceeding to Step 3.**

### Step 3: Generate Complete Report

After all agents complete, compile their findings into **TMQAReport.md**:

```markdown

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Address critical issues (HIGH severity)
2. Review and fix failed tasks
3. Update documentation gaps
4. Reduce technical debt
5. Re-run tmQA after fixes

---

**Report End** ‚Ä¢ Generated by tmQA v1.0 ‚Ä¢ üî¥
```

Save this report to: **Docs/TMQAReport.md**

### Step 4: Review & Take Action

1. Read the complete TMQAReport.md
2. Address critical issues first (HIGH severity üî¥)
3. Create follow-up tasks for medium issues
4. Update task statuses based on findings
5. Schedule technical debt reduction work

## üî¥ Best Practices

1. **Run tmQA regularly** - Weekly or before releases
2. **Don't skip critical issues** - Address HIGH severity items immediately
3. **Track trends** - Compare reports over time
4. **Learn from patterns** - Fix root causes, not symptoms
5. **Maintain documentation** - Keep TMQAReport.md updated
6. **Re-verify after fixes** - Run tmQA again on fixed tasks

## üö® Common Red Flags

### üî¥ "Non funziona un cazzo"
**Symptoms:**
- Feature not working
- Build broken
- Tests failing
- Runtime crashes

**QA Action:**
- Status: `in-progress`
- Severity: HIGH
- Immediate fix required

### üî¥ "Technical Debt Bomb"
**Symptoms:**
- Multiple TODO/FIXME comments
- Duplicated code everywhere
- No tests
- Hardcoded values

**QA Action:**
- Status: `review`
- Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Refactoring required

### üî¥ "Ghost Implementation"
**Symptoms:**
- Task marked done
- No code actually written
- No commits found
- Files don't exist

**QA Action:**
- Status: `pending`
- Severity: HIGH
- Re-implementation required

### üî¥ "Documentation Desert"
**Symptoms:**
- No comments
- No README updates
- No ADRs
- No CHANGELOG entry

**QA Action:**
- Status: `review`
- Severity: MEDIUM
- Documentation sprint required

## üìÇ Report Location

All QA reports are saved to:
```
Docs/TMQAReport.md
```

Archive previous reports with date:
```bash
mv Docs/TMQAReport.md Docs/archive/TMQAReport-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If agents fail to complete:**
- Run serially instead of parallel
- Check API keys are configured
- Reduce batch size
- Check system resources

**If report generation fails:**
- Manually compile agent reports
- Use template structure above
- Save partial results
- Re-run failed tasks

## üìù Integration with Task Master

The tmQA process integrates seamlessly with Task Master:

```bash
# Run QA before major milestones
/tmQA

# After fixes, re-verify specific tasks
/review-task <task-id>

# Update tasks with QA findings
task-master update-task --id=<id> --prompt="QA findings: ..."

# Change status based on QA results
task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=review
```

## üéØ Remember

**The goal is not to punish - it's to improve!**

- Quality issues are learning opportunities
- Technical debt is normal - managing it is key
- Documentation gaps can be filled
- Failed QA ‚â† failed developer
- Use findings to improve processes

**üî¥ "Fatto bene √® meglio di fatto veloce"** - Done well is better than done fast!
